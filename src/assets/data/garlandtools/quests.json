To that end, the bookseller will part with a rare tome which details the Zodiac Weapons, but only if you can furnish her with the following rare items: a Bronze Lake crystal, a Bombard core, and a bottle of sacred spring water. The first of these may be found in the vicinity of the lake of its namesake.",
        "Having painstakingly obtained the requested items, you return to Papana only to find that their quality is not to her satisfaction. Judging them insufficient payment for the book, Papana further asks you fetch her a horn of the beast which prowls Dzemael Darkhold, and a gobmachine bangplate from Brayflox's Longstop.<br><br>※Dzemael Darkhold and Brayflox's Longstop (Hard) can be accessed via the Duty Finder.",

The Lalafellin shopkeep will now settle for nothing less than a Narasimha hide and a sickle fang, highly prized objects found only within Halatali and Snowcloak.<br><br>※Halatali (Hard) and Snowcloak can be accessed via the Duty Finder.",

        "Your prayers go unanswered, for Papana has yet another request to make of you. Rowena, the bookseller explains, has tasked her with incinerating those tomes that are unfit to sell, and only when this chore is finished can she turn her attention back to you. If you would obtain your book, suppress your desire to scream, and bring Papana a high-quality furnace ring and a bundle of perfect firewood.<br><br>※Certain ingredients required to craft these items can be obtained by desynthesizing aged goods sold at the Silver Bazaar.",

In wistful tones, she tells you of her misspent youth, and of her admiration and respect for G'jusana. Thanking you for your part in helping her dear friend get closer to financial freedom, Papana presents you with the object of your desire: the Book of Skylight. With the knowledge held within, Gerolt may now faithfully recreate such an arm as was wielded by the Zodiac Braves of legend.<br><br>※If you have obtained all four items requested by Gerolt, you may return to Hyrstmill to have your Zodiac Weapon forged."

        "Trunk-like arms akimbo, Guiding Star seems to radiate a deep understanding of crafting.",
        "His passion for crafting stirred by news of your quest to restore the arm of a Zodiac Brave, Guiding Star sets about devising a compound capable of becoming the weapon's frame. He lights upon Allagan resin as the ideal base for such a substance, and bids you scour southern Thanalan's markets for a lump of the stuff.",
        "With an excited light in his eyes, Guiding Star accepts the Allagan resin, remarking that no other material in Eorzea is so mutable. Now that you have secured the substance's base, he goes on, an ore known as vale bubo is required to grant it rigidity, as well as a piece of voidweave to lend it a measure of suppleness. To procure such seldom-seen materials, you will have no choice but to brave the horrors of the Aurum Vale and Haukke Manor respectively.<br><br>※The Aurum Vale and Haukke Manor (Hard) can be accessed via the Duty Finder.",
        "The threats of the Vale and voidsent are at your back, and the vale bubo and voidweave safely in your possession. Deliver them now to Guiding Star in Revenant's Toll.",
        "Now in possession of the wherewithal to make his proposed compound indurate and supple, Guiding Star's thoughts turn to imbuing it with elegance and beauty. He feels a slip of Amdapor vellum from the lost city will lend the former, and an Indigo pearl from Sastasha the latter. As ever, it would seem you will have to risk all if you are to reap the rewards...<br><br>※The Lost City of Amdapor and Sastasha (Hard) can be accessed via the Duty Finder.",
        "After shedding no small amount of blood, sweat, and tears, you now grasp a piece of Amdapor vellum and an Indigo pearl. Make your way back to Revenant's Toll, where it is to be hoped far fewer perils await.",
        "All four ingredients now in his hands, Guiding Star thanks you for your tireless labor, and explains the next step: grinding the materials together to intermingle their powers. Alas, his puny mixing instruments are apparently incapable of withstanding the titanic forces which will be released in the process. Accordingly, he bids you find the only tools equal to the task: a perfect mortar and pestle, both of high quality.<br><br>※Certain ingredients required to craft these items can be obtained by desynthesizing aged goods sold at the Silver Bazaar.",
        "You hand the perfect tools to Guiding Star, who is nigh salivating at the prospect of using them. Though his thanks are as effusive as ever, you sense that yet another request is in the offing─and are swiftly proved right when the craftsman tasks you with two further acquisitions: a Bombard core to heat the compound, and a bottle of sacred spring water to cool it afterwards.",
        "All ingredients assembled, Guiding Star now sets to work crafting. Sweat streaming over a brow deeply furrowed with concentration, you watch as he grinds, hammers, heats, and cools. The result is zodium, a material of unsurpassed bonding perfect for recreating your arm of yore. Handing the material to you with a joyous laugh, the craftsman thanks you for giving him the chance to make something so wondrous, and prays the Builder Himself will give you success in remaking your arm of legend.<br><br>※If you have obtained all four items requested by Gerolt, you may return to Hyrstmill to have your Zodiac Weapon forged."

Find and deliver all three.",

He gives it to you with a few words of encouragement on your quest to recreate a legendary arm, all the while crowing that his achievement will bring him all the closer to becoming Master Mutamix's favorite disciple.<br><br>※If you have obtained all four items requested by Gerolt, you may return to Hyrstmill to have your Zodiac Weapon forged."

Much to your surprise, however, the smith reveals that there is yet work to be done─awakening sentience itself within your Zodiac Weapon. Indeed, it would seem the arms of legend consciously bonded with the soul of their bearers. Upon overhearing this, Jalzahn pledges to postpone his homewards journey. He posits that certain varieties of crystal can transfer a sense─a fragment of consciousness─via soul resonance, and thereby awaken the sentience slumbering within your weapon. To obtain these crystals, Gerolt tasks you with obtaining an introduction to Remon, a man of the black market, from Rowena in Revenant's Toll. Go now and speak with her.",
        "According to Rowena, Remon holds an old grudge against Gerolt─the result of an unpaid loan─and will not deal with any friend of the blacksmith without an apology from the man himself. Return to Hyrstmill and inform Gerolt of this, and that Remon resides in his “usual haunt.”",
        "According to Gerolt, Remon's bitterness stems not from the loan unpaid, but rather from a love unrequited─though he will say no more on the subject. Jalzahn urges Gerolt to make his amends with a gift: the bottle of Sunshine. Once you, too, have added your voice to the proceedings, Gerolt reluctantly gives up his prized liquor. Take the bottle of Sunshine and seek out Remon in Swiftperch.",

Wasting no time, the researcher, one Ardashir, declares that he has been conducting research into the creation of artificial life─something he refers to as “anima.” Though all of his trials have thus far ended in failure, he is convinced that the Sharlayans' work on arcane sentries holds the key to success. Before he can continue with his suit, however, Gerolt decries him for his lack of imagination, and wryly suggests fusing the anima with a weapon─a proposal which Ardashir considers a stroke of genius. Never one to miss a chance to turn a profit, Rowena sets about persuading Gerolt to take part in the venture, and before you know it, you too have been roped in to test the finished product. You are to rendezvous with Ardashir and Gerolt in Azys Lla, where the pair will apparently be working.",

All the necessary elements are in place save two: astral and umbral nodules, the catalysts required to facilitate the process of channeling aether into the soulstone. Unsure of where to procure them, Ardashir suggests speaking with Rowena in Revenant's Toll. With any luck, she will know of a merchant who can provide what he needs.<br><br>※You may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest.",

        "Upon speaking with Syndony, it soon becomes clear that your reputation has preceded you. When you inquire about the nodules, she is taken aback by your outlandish request, but is not deterred from the challenge of producing what you seek. The process will require elementally aspected luminous crystals, and she insists you bring her one of every element. However, she also believes there may be one other way: bringing her a Zodiac Weapon of the highest order. Seeing your nonplussed expression, she concedes that such a legendary weapon may be no more than a rumor.<br><br>※Should you be unwilling or unable to offer a suitable Zodiac Weapon, luminous crystals can be obtained by participating in FATEs in the following regions:<br>- Sea of Clouds: luminous wind crystals<br>- Azys Lla: luminous fire crystals<br>- Churning Mists: luminous lightning crystals<br>- Coerthas western highlands: luminous ice crystals<br>- Dravanian forelands: luminous earth crystals<br>- Dravanian hinterlands: luminous water crystals",
        "With the nodules in hand, Ardashir is at last ready to go through with Gerolt's plan. He duly completes the infusion of aether, and hands the pulsating soulstone to Gerolt, who immediately sets about affixing the radiant gem to your weapon. Some time later, the sweating smith finally lowers his hammer, a look of both exhaustion and satisfaction on his face. The plan has succeeded and you are the proud owner of an anima weapon. Now begins the journey to discover its full potential."

        "Ardashir seems curious to see how the anima will develop.<br>※Changing classes or jobs will prevent progress during this quest.",
        "The anima now residing in your weapon is as a newborn babe in mortal terms. In order to foster this fledgling spirit, Gerolt suggests that you treat it to some good old-fashioned combat. Knowing that you have been involved in more than a few titanic battles over the years, he recommends revisiting the sites of some of your most memorable encounters. Hearing this, Ardashir asks to accompany you to ensure the anima's development does not go undocumented. When you subsequently look back upon your past exploits, the frost-rimed halls of Snowcloak spring to mind. Perhaps Coerthas would be a good place to begin the anima's education.<br><br>※You may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest.",
        "With anima weapon in hand, you fight your way through Snowcloak's frozen chambers, and emerge none the worse for wear. While contemplating your next destination, a glinting fish in the half-frozen water nearby catches your eye, and in that moment you decide where to continue the anima's education: the Sastasha Seagrot.<br><br>※The prerequisite quests for Sastasha (Hard) must be completed before continuing with this quest.",
        "The drowned Reavers of the Seagrot are no match for you and your new weapon. Soaked to the skin from your aquatic adventure, you elect to continue the anima's education in a warmer and dryer location. And where could be warmer or dryer than the Sunken Temple of Qarn?<br><br>※The prerequisite quests for The Sunken Temple of Qarn (Hard) must be completed before continuing with this quest.",
        "You fight off the wildlife now roaming the halls of Qarn, avoiding the perils of still-lingering traps and snares along the way. While such feats are all in a day's work for the Warrior of Light, the same cannot be said of Ardashir, who has done well to follow you to this point. Trouble him for his thoughts on the journey thus far.",
        "Ardashir asks if you have noticed any changes in the anima since the start of your journey, but you have nothing of note to report. Undiscouraged, you resolve to revisit the Keeper of the Lake, and drive off any Garlean forces that may be salvaging the wreckage there.",
        "Unable to stay your advance, the Garleans retreat, and the Keeper of the Lake sleeps soundly once more. For the anima's next lesson, you decide to revisit the Wanderer's Palace, to ensure that the Mamool Ja pose no further threat to the tonberries.<br><br>※The prerequisite quests for The Wanderer's Palace (Hard) must be completed before continuing with this quest.",
        "With the aid of the anima weapon, you drive the Mamool Ja out of the Wanderer's Palace, leaving the tonberries in peace. When you subsequently pause to consider a suitable venue for your next lesson, you are reminded of a malevolent force which once took hold of Amdapor Keep. Never quite convinced that the darkness had been truly banished, you resolve to make for the Shroud.<br><br>※The prerequisite quests for Amdapor Keep (Hard) must be completed before continuing with this quest.",
        "Once more, Amdapor Keep has been purged of foul spirits. As you pause to catch your breath, you notice that Ardashir seems oddly distracted. Ask him what is occupying his thoughts.",
        "Despite the ever-present danger of death, it would seem that Ardashir has been struck by the beauty of Eorzea. Plainly, her wonders are easier to appreciate when you are not the one doing the fighting. With nothing to report on the anima's development, you turn to leave, but pause to look back when you sense a familiar presence nearby. Seeing no one, you dismiss the feeling as a trick of the imagination, and ponder where to go next. In the end, you settle on the Dusk Vigil, that once-proud fortress left to the wild beasts of Coerthas.<br><br>※The prerequisite quests for the Dusk Vigil must be completed before continuing with this quest.",
        "Wielding the anima weapon with consummate skill, you leave the living denizens of the Dusk Vigil dead, and the dead ones in pieces. Soon after, with the enemies of Ishgard still fresh in your mind, your thoughts turn to dragons. Perhaps some remnant of the Horde lingers on the slopes of Sohm Al...",
        "On the slopes of Sohm Al, you lay low the minions of Nidhogg in what you hope to be an educational fashion. The threat of dragons still looms, however, and so you journey to the Aery to strike once more against Ishgard's greatest foe. ",
        "Though your visit to the Aery severely taxed your strength, it is not yet time to rest. Nevertheless, you bid Ardashir make for the safety of Ishgard, for where you mean to go, he cannot follow. Rather than face the enemies without, you choose to face the enemies <span class=\"emphasis\">within</span>─your memories, that is. Using the power of your mind, you will relive your battle in the Vault.",
        "Though your reenactment of the battle in the Vault only loosely corresponded to the actual event, you are hopeful that the experience was of some benefit. When you subsequently reflect on the lengths to which you have gone to nurture the anima, you suddenly recall a strange occurrence in the Black Shroud which you suspect may be significant. Speak with Ardashir and tell him what you saw.",
        "Ardashir's eyes grow wide with wonder upon hearing your account of the anima. He leaves immediately for Azys Lla, and asks that you rejoin him there as soon as you are able.",
        "Upon arriving, you find Ardashir abuzz with excitement, much to Gerolt's evident irritation. You interrupt the pair's bickering with the revelation that the anima can speak. While Ardashir is dumbstruck by the implications of this discovery, Gerolt wants nothing more than to go home, and asks for your weapon that he might make some final adjustments. The blacksmith duly gives the thing an exceedingly thorough pounding, his arm granted new strength by his thirst for ale, but even he is unprepared for what follows. Without warning, the weapon begins to glow as if alive. Though you sense the fledgling anima still has some way to go, you look forward to seeing it grow."

To ensure all your hard work is not wasted, he plans to fortify the soulstone, as well as have Gerolt forge a new weapon to hold it. This new weapon, however, will require four materials essential for conducting large quantities of aether: enchanted rubber, fast-drying carboncoat, fast-acting Allagan catalyst, and divine water. Gerolt suggests seeking out a merchant named Cristiana at the House of Splendors in Mor Dhona who may have what he requires.<br><br>※You may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest.",

She demands several expertly exotic goods in exchange for the materials Gerolt asked for. Whether you fashion them, find them, or trade for them, you must acquire what Gerolt needs if you are to complete the anima weapon.",

The familiar ring of his hammer fills the air, but the medley soon comes to a halt. His latest masterpiece is complete, and your weapon is born anew! You hold it aloft, basking in its light, when what appears to be a sprite takes shape before you and thanks you for all you have done. You smile and nod, knowing your journey together has only just begun."

        "Ardashir is determined to supplement the anima's aetheric energies so that it might relay its thoughts clearly and concisely. To that end, he proposes improving the aetherial conductivity of the weapon not only to give the anima the strength to converse, but to allow those without the Echo to comprehend that which is communicated. Gerolt begrudgingly agrees to assist. To work on the anima weapon, however, he must first insulate his tools with a soulglaze, and for that he requires five pots of aether oil. He bids you seek out Eorzea's traders of ancient antiquities to procure what he requires.<br><br>※You may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest.",
        "You return with pots of aether oil in hand to find Gerolt in unusually high spirits. He soon reveals the reason for his good mood, namely that he has, in fact, consumed a large volume of spirits. Deaf to Ardashir's plea to lower his hammer, Gerolt begins pounding away with surprising speed and precision. It is not long before his work is complete and you take up a weapon seemingly alive with aether. As you raise it high to bask in its warm glow, the anima suddenly manifests itself to you. It is thankful for its newfound strength, and vows to do what it can to aid you in your coming adventures. Though he cannot yet perceive the anima, Ardashir is glad to see you sharing such a lengthy exchange, and looks forward to seeing how the anima will take shape under your guidance."

        "The bond between you and the anima is stronger than ever. Though its development hereafter is but a matter of course, Ardashir believes he can hasten the process. He proposes a short voyage to Idyllshire to meet with an acquaintance, one Ulan. A fellow researcher and enthusiast of Carbuncles, she has devoted her life to the study of arcane entities and methods by which they can be enhanced. He is all but certain her work is the key to unlocking the anima's potential. And with that, you are off to Idyllshire.<br><br>※You may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest.<br>※Please note this quest cannot be abandoned via the journal. If you wish to abandon the quest, you may do so at any time by speaking with Ardashir.",
        "The focus of Ulan's research, as she tells it, is the use of crystal sand to promote growth in arcane constructs. Normally one must strike a proper balance of elements for the procedure to work, a process which may take weeks or even months. Thankfully, she realizes you are not one to waste time. To that end she suggests the use of umbrite, an umbral-aspected stone that can strip the elements from crystal sand, eliminating the need to finely attune its elemental properties. With that knowledge she bids you gather the crystal sand and umbrite necessary to foster the anima's development to your liking.",
        "Ulan's plan is a success. With the crystal sand lacking any elemental aspects, the anima readily consumes it, reaching new heights of strength. Both you and Ulan are impressed by the results, even more so when the anima insists on consuming greater quantities of the treated crystal sand. Though it is not without risk, Ardashir consents to the request, stating the anima is free to make its own choices. He suspects this will also require a new weapon better suited to the anima's burgeoning strength. As a preemptive measure, he returns to Azys Lla to make preparations with Gerolt. His suspicions are soon confirmed when, after several applications of crystal sand, the anima appears before you whimpering and in pain. Ulan bids you meet with Ardashir and see what can be done to help.",
        "You arrive at Azys Lla to find Ardashir and Gerolt ready with a freshly forged weapon to house the anima's soulstone. After verifying the stone is still in one piece, they carefully transplant it into a new vessel. You raise the weapon high, admiring its beauty, when suddenly the anima appears before you. And at last, after years of research and countless failures, Ardashir is able to behold the anima in all its splendor. His dream finally realized, the fledgling researcher must now set his sights higher in his pursuits of cultivating artificial life.<br><br>※ The attributes of the anima weapon can be reallocated by speaking with Ulan in Idyllshire."

        "Ardashir is seemingly satisfied with the results of his research thus far─so much so, that he soon plans to return to Radz–at–Han where he will present his findings. Gerolt, on the other hand, is baffled by this presumption, and wastes no time reprimanding him. Ardashir reluctantly accepts the truth─that their work is not yet complete─and soon offers a means to temporarily fortify the anima weapon. For his plan to work, however, it requires a ceruleum solution which he has commissioned from a skilled distiller in Idyllshire. While he begins other preparations for the anima weapon, he asks you to meet with this artisan, one Blamprest, in Idyllshire.<br><br>※You may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest.",
        "Blamprest assures you work on Ardashir's order is well underway. He has been delayed, however, by a need for singing clusters. Though difficult to acquire, he has entrusted the task to a pair of sisters─skilled mages who agreed to help...for a price. No sooner does he mention the pair than they appear before you seeking compensation for their work. Much to your surprise─and dismay─he tells them that you have eagerly agreed to pay for them in his stead. They have yet to explain how you must pay them, but as your only alternative is to bargain at Rowena's Center for Cultural Promotion, you steel yourself to undertake trials of unknown peril.",
        "After subjecting yourself to the peculiar whims of Amphelice and Angelet, you at last deliver the singing clusters to Blamprest, who then crafts for you the elixir needed for the anima weapon's fortifying potion. With your work complete and the elixir in hand, he bids you safe travels back to Azys Lla.",
        "You return to Azys Lla, elixir in hand. The second bottle you place on Ardashir's workbench, however, leaves him perplexed. When you explain to him it was an order for spirits placed by Gerolt, he then comes to a sudden and startling realization─Gerolt squandered a portion of the money lent to them by Rowena to make the purchase. Though he is furious, he cannot deny the strange yet beneficial effects of alcohol on Gerolt's work. After regaining his composure, he completes his potion, and sets Gerolt to work on fortifying the anima weapon. Much to their delight, Ardashir's plan was a success. Moreover, he goes on to show you an Allagan droid that may be the key to ensuring the anima's longevity, assuming it can be repaired.<br><br>※ The attributes of the anima weapon can be reallocated by speaking with Ulan in Idyllshire."

The only condition, however, is that you do so at the scene of battle, as that is the only way to quicken the magicks of her fabric. Though the locales she insists upon are likely still teeming with danger, you are not one to balk at a challenge. And so you make haste to the sites of your past adventures.<br><br>※The key item can be obtained by clearing a dungeon via Duty Roulette: Level 50/60/70/80 Dungeons.",
        "Your stroll down memory lane was fraught with peril, but both you and Angelet's magicked cloth remain none the worse for wear, and surprisingly no different. Which seems peculiar since, according to Angelet, there should be some discernible difference in the cloth. Perhaps she can explain what, if any, change has taken place.",
        "Angelet is beaming with excitement upon your return, and the reason for her elation gives you pause. As she explains it, her profession is the crafting of dolls using cursed materials. What was once an ostensibly normal bolt of fabric is now replete with the pain and suffering of your fallen enemies. As promised, she bequeaths to you the singing cluster you desire.

        "Ardashir has good news to share with you─work on the processing node vital to his work is nearly complete. His elation is soon dampened, however, when Gerolt rebukes him for not lifting a finger to help. The young scholar soon insists on doing his fair share of the work, but never fear─there is plenty to go around. Ardashir wastes no time in splitting up his duties, tasking you with obtaining three oddities needed to forge the new anima weapon: a rare gemstone from Amdapor, a magicked doll from the Great Gubal Library, and molten rock from Sohm Al.",
        "Braving the perils of Eorzea's darkest dungeons you emerge unscathed, and three rarities richer for the experience. You can only hope Ardashir will have completed his tasks by the time you get back.",
        "You arrive in Azys Lla to find the processing node is fully operational. Not wanting to waste time, Ardashir insists Gerolt ignore his thirst for ale and begin work on the weapon. Meanwhile, he would have you activate the now-functioning node.",
        "The node springs to life with a buzz and a whir, ready to fashion you a soulstone. Assuming you have the required materials, of course. When you are finished with the processing node, Ardashir asks that you activate the verification node in preparation for the anima's transfer.",
        "Moving the anima to a new soulstone will incur great risk, as there is a chance the fledgling spirit will dissipate into the aether before the process is complete. After extensive research, however, Ardashir has discovered the means to ensure the anima's safety: increasing its aetheric density. As he explains it, the anima weapon's recent treatment of ceruleum has enhanced its aether-absorbing abilities, making now the opportune time to carry out his plan. He furnishes you with a monitoring device, and bids you continue your routine acts of heroism. When the anima has absorbed sufficient levels of aether, his most recent discovery─the verification node─will analyze the anima weapon and determine your chances of success. Ardashir is not one to gamble, however, and says he will not be satisfied until failure is a mathematical improbability.<br><br>※Should you misplace the anima glass, you may obtain a new one by speaking with Ardashir at Azys Lla.",
        "You traverse the realm to fortify the anima through feats of heroism both great and small, from saving cats trapped on cold stone rooves to slaying beasts sent from the void. Confident that the anima is ready, you return to Azys Lla to have the anima weapon examined. The verification node begins its analysis, and after what seems an eternity, you are pleased to hear the chance of failure is nigh on impossible. All that remains is carrying out the transfer.",
        "His plans have been perfect, his calculations impeccable, yet Ardashir cannot dismiss his impending sense of dread. His doubts are soon cast aside, however, when Gerolt surprises him with a few choice words reminiscent of encouragement. Duly inspired, they set to work, and it is not long before the anima is placed securely in its new soulstone and weapon...or so they think. You hold your freshly forged weapon aloft, but when you call forth the anima, the lack of response gives you pause. Just when Ardashir had begun to lose hope, the anima appears from a blinding flash of light, regaling you with talk of an otherworldly experience. The anima is safe, now and forevermore. But Ardashir mentions he has one last order of business to discuss with you. Whatever could it be?<br><br>※ The attributes of the anima weapon can be reallocated by speaking with Ulan in Idyllshire."

As the young scholar explains it, he had sent documents outlining his research to a renowned authority of arcane magicks, who has seen fit to favor him with a response. Eager though he is to know what wisdom they have to share, he cannot neglect his present work. He asks that you precede him and meet with Rowena in Idyllshire.",

He quickly regains his composure, that he might pore over the sage words of the scholar─who is revealed to be none other than the legendary Matoya. Though her missive is marked with praise for his work, it is not without criticism. To wit, she has reason to believe that Ardashir's approach thus far may have failed to instill the anima with a sufficient sense of individuality. Based on his writings, she has offered a proposal to rectify this issue. And so he returns to Azys Lla to tell Gerolt of the good news.",

        "Ardashir is eager to put Matoya's sage counsel into practice.<br>※Changing classes or jobs will prevent progress during this quest.",
        "Having carefully pored over Matoya's missive, Ardashir explains that the primals are the key to the anima's enlightenment. He asks that you relive your fiercest battles with these celestial beings─not on the battlefield, but within your mind. Linked as you are to the anima, he posits that it would be as if your aetherial companion experienced these epic battles firsthand. Heeding his request, you take a deep breath, still your mind, and think back to your first encounter with the godlike beings known as primals.",
        "You awake with a start, your heart still racing from your vivid recollections of your confrontations with Ifrit, Garuda, and Titan. Yet there is still much for you to share with the anima. You close your eyes once more and prepare to summon from the depths of your memory yet another harrowing battle with the primals.",
        "You open your eyes again for a short reprieve from reliving the more arduous experiences of your past. With the memories of combat still fresh in your mind, you check─perhaps out of habit─to be certain your garb is neither soaked nor singed from battle. Alas, there is no rest for the weary, for many tales of derring-do remain untold. Again you clear your mind, and summon forth a vision of strife and struggle against the unbridled fury of the primals.",
        "The ring of steel echoes in your ears as you stir back to consciousness. Though the confrontations have taken place entirely within your mind's eye, your muscles are strangely sore, your body stiff as if from great physical exertion. And yet, there is still one tale to tell─of three gods locked in perpetual conflict, and the brave soul that dared to bring them low.",
        "You return to your senses in a cold sweat, a sigh of relief escaping from your lips as you realize the battles were all in your mind. Though it was not in the flesh that you faced these encounters anew, your sharp and stirring memories of your great deeds will doubtless prove of great value to the anima. Having exhausted your repository of grueling memories of your confrontations with the primals, you seek out Ardashir, that together you might awaken the anima's newfound knowledge.",
        "Ardashir would proceed with the next stage of Matoya's plan: namely, to employ an enchantment to ingrain the anima's newly gained knowledge into the core of its being. There is, however, a rub─all the materials needed for the procedure are readily available save one─an ancient variety of enchanted ink said to be made only in the lands of Sharlayan. Knowing of no merchants who might deal in such exotic goods, Ardashir defers to your unequaled talent for procurement.",
        "Through means available only to one of your experience and expertise, you procure a bottle of archaic enchanted ink and deliver it to Ardashir. He follows Matoya's instructions to the letter, outlining an arcane circle for the spell and gently placing the anima weapon in its center. As your aether flows into the circle, you focus your thoughts on the anima, which soon manifests before you. Your hearts and minds are as one now, the anima acutely aware of your faith and aspirations for the journey to come. The deep attachment you feel toward the anima has cast away its fears, leaving only hope and an unshakable resolve. After myriad trials and tribulations, your aetherial companion has truly come into its own. Though you know not what the future may hold, you take comfort in knowing that whatever perils you may face, you will not face them alone. Indeed, your foes must now stand against the might of the anima."

The island in question is apparently somewhere in the Far East, and if you are interested in learning more, you will have no choice but to journey once more to distant Kugane and speak with Kotokaze, the esteemed proprietress of the Shiokaze Hostelry.",
        "After being shown to a private table, you are joined by Krile, as well as Rowena and Hancock, who have recently become partners after a fashion. The pair explain that they have joined forces in an effort to develop the aforementioned island, which could serve as a new port of call for trading vessels seeking to circumvent the high tariffs of Kugane. Alas, this will not be a simple endeavor, as the previous expedition met with failure at the hands─rather, the claws and teeth─of the innumerable savage beasts that inhabit the island. Warriors of consummate skill are needed, and you stand above all others in their minds. Krile, for her part, has a personal stake in the expedition, though she begs leave to say no more unless her suspicions regarding the island prove true.",
        "Duly advised to go on ahead to the waiting expedition vessel, you come upon Gerolt Blackthorne, by all accounts the finest weaponsmith in all of Eorzea─and an accomplished drunkard besides─locked in a bitter dispute with a belligerent scholar who you soon learn is Ejika Tsunjika of the Students of Baldesion. A contemporary of Krile, he demands to take part in the expedition, having learned of Krile's interest in the island. Krile consents, and Ejika boards without further comment─for the time being. All that remains is to journey to the mysterious island dubbed “Eureka” and see what mysteries await..."

        "You agree to lend your strength to the Bozjan Resistance, and Marsak wastes no time in preparing a ship to ferry you to their base of operations. He bids you meet him at the Doman Enclave when you are ready to embark.",
        "You find Marsak waiting for you patiently at the dock. Prepared to depart, you speak with the ferryman who ushers the two of you onto his airship.",
        "No sooner do you arrive at the Resistance camp than you find yourself face-to-face with Bajsaljen, leader of the Bozjan Resistance. He and his comrades explain to you their plan─to reforge the legendary weapons of Gunnhildr's Blades. Despite the scarcity of recordings relating to Queen Gunnhildr and her guard, they have made great strides in reproducing their vaunted arms. The key to their completion is a holy inscription engraved upon them, any traces of which were lost when Bozja Citadel fell many years ago. For their plans to move forward, they have enlisted the aid of an old friend─Mikoto.",
        "In perhaps a few too many words, and a demonstration assisted by Gerolt, Mikoto expounds further on their plans. Borrowing the long-forgotten techniques of Bozjan seers, you must use a special crystal focus to enter the memories of those who may have seen the holy inscription required to reforge Gunnhildr's weapons. The problem, however, is that anyone who had glimpsed the inscription perished when Bozja Citadel was destroyed. Or so they thought. While contemplating the possibility of survivors, Mikoto is struck by a vision of the future. In it, she sees Cid Garlond, convincing her that he is the eyewitness you are searching for.",
        "While strangely reluctant, Bajsaljen understands that Cid Garlond is likely your only hope of forging Gunnhildr's weapons. And so he bids you go to Rhalgr's Reach and speak with the Ironworks engineers there to find him.",
        "Speaking with a fledgling engineer in Rhalgr's Reach, it seems as though Cid is too preoccupied to help. Thankfully, Jessie happens to overhear your conversation and clears up any misconceptions regarding his present commitments. Before taking her leave, Jessie asks that you proceed with caution, fearful of what horrors may be unearthed from Cid's past.",
        "Arrangements have been made for Cid to meet you at the Doman Enclave. As you make your way to meet him, you cannot help but wonder what secrets his memories may hold."

Though apprehensive of what awaits him at Gangos, Cid reaffirms his commitment to helping the Bozjan Resistance. Together you board the airship which bears the two of you to Gangos.",
        "Together with Mikoto you delve into Cid's memories of Bozja Citadel. An arduous journey through his mind eventually leads you to a massive transmission tower, wherein you confront a manifestation of Cid's trauma in the form of Lord Varis.",
        "The phantom of Cid's past is laid low, but something about this glimpse into the past still appears amiss. Realizing Lord Varis had no reason to be present at the citadel, he strains to remember who was the source of this anguished memory. In an instant his mind becomes clear, and the visage of Lord Varis is replaced by the man who shot him so many years ago─his own father, Midas nan Garlond. What's more, a closer inspection reveals he is in fact a thrall of the dreadwyrm Bahamut. With the mystery of Cid's past brought to light, you return to the waking world with the inscriptions of the blades of Gunnhildr, as well as an onerous truth.",

This insight makes clear to him that the weapons require a final ingredient before they can be completed─a special powder highly conductive to aether. Much to his dismay, the one best suited to acquiring this for you is none other than Rowena. At the risk of incurring more debt, he asks you to meet with her in Kugane to make an arrangement on behalf of the Bozjan Resistance.<br><br>※You may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest.",

With matters settled in Kugane, you return to Gangos, eager to see the fruits of Gerolt's labor.",

Having recently reclaimed Utya's Aegis, an outpost on the southern front, Marsak has asked Sjeros to escort you there, that you might assess the situation for yourself.",

The remaining members have already taken to the field, laboring to advance the front line toward the castrum. Having thus explained the situation, it occurs to Bajsaljen that you have yet to see the fortress with your own eyes. Seeking to rectify this, he invites you to look out over the battlefield and behold the object of their struggles.",
        "As you look upon the castrum, towering in the distance, Bajsaljen speaks to you of their initiative to reclaim it, Operation Eagle's Nest. Before you join his troops in the field, however, he asks that you speak with Mikoto.",
        "You find Mikoto in the company of Misija, and they have exciting news to share─an analysis of the crystal focus has proven that it can be recharged. The problem, however, is the means to do so requires infiltrating imperial territory. Nevertheless, plans to restore the crystal focus are well underway. Plans that will require your assistance to succeed.",

The threat of the queen proved too great, forcing the Resistance to retreat from the castrum.",

        "A report from Bwagi reveals the imperial legion's strength is not what it seems. In fact, they are now starved for resources, which has prompted allied forces from Dalmasca and Nagxia to launch an assault and thus slow the arrival of reinforcements to Bozja. The meeting is soon interrupted when a fatigued soldier enters, warning of yet another sighting of Queen Gunnhildr. For reasons as yet unknown, this prompts Mikoto to run off, likely to the southern front.",
        "What Mikoto expects to find on the battlefield remains to be seen, but the others bid you go and find her, fearful she may discover more than she hopes for.",
        "You find Mikoto unharmed, spying on Misija and a group of imperials. Once again, the vision of Queen Gunnhildr appears, though her power is noticeably diminished from your previous encounter. As you turn to leave, Mikoto's gift of the Echo offers an insight into the future─she sees the Resistance cornering Misija, who is unable to wield the power of Save the Queen. Mikoto would waste no time in relaying this news to the Resistance.",
        "Mikoto is convinced the apparition Misija has used to drive back Resistance forces is born of the memories of the late Queen Gunnhildr. She goes on to explain the fabled blade Save the Queen was likely designed to function in a similar fashion to the auracite you encountered in Rabanastre. Assuming this is true, Misija's plans cannot come to fruition without a substantial cache of crystals, meaning there may yet be time for the Resistance to strike back."

        "Bajsaljen would waste no time in dealing with Misija.",
        "Mikoto is convinced that Misija has exhausted the power of Save the Queen, and her vision of the near future suggests both Misija and Save the Queen can be taken into custody without bloodshed. Marsak readies their soldiers and sets out for ruins on the eastern edge of the southern front in the hopes of catching Misija unawares.",
        "Events play out exactly as Mikoto foresaw. The Resistance manages to corner Misija who is unable to summon Queen Gunnhildr to battle. What Mikoto failed to see, however, is that this was all according to Misija's plan, for she too can now peer into the future. Imperial enforcements soon arrive, and a terrible battle ensues there in the ruins.",
        "No sooner do you bring low Misija's imperial soldiers than more arrive to take their place. But your battle was only meant to stall for time, as they manage to open a door leading deeper into the ruins, prompting Misija and Gunnhildr's Blades to escape into the shadows. You follow her into the heart of Delubrum Reginae, where you hope to put an end to her schemes and retrieve Save the Queen. ",
        "Deep within the heart of the ruins, Misija at last finds what she was searching for─a massive crystal rife with the aether needed to summon the full might of Save the Queen. Yet for all its power, the ancient blade proves no match for you. With the day won at last, you take the now-dormant Bozjan relic and an unconscious Misija back to Gangos.",
        "Misija has been placed in solitary confinement awaiting trial, and Bajsaljen believes it best if Save the Queen remain in Mikoto's care for the time being. But there will be no reprieve to study its inner workings, for an imperial warship can be seen approaching in the distance. Bajsaljen orders everyone to withdraw to Gangos and prepare to make a stand.",
        "When the Resistance next steps onto the battlefield, they will be joined by their allies from the Far East. Considering all that is at stake, there is no question that your strength will be needed when that day comes."

However, the means to analyze the aetherial properties of these memories yet eludes him. Enter Regana, accompanied by an Allagan node commissioned from Garlond Ironworks designed to do precisely that. Though daunted by the potential ramifications of accepting further help─financial or otherwise─Zlatan can see no other way to proceed with Gerolt's plan. As Regana explains, the node will use gathered memories to create a registry with which you can modify the Resistance weapon as you see fit. Hoping for an adequate sample size, Gerolt suggests searching for two types of memories, eighteen of each.<br><br>※Memories of the dying can be found from certain FATEs and alliance raids.<br>※Haunting memories of the dying can be found from FATEs in the Gyr Abania region, or the Shadow of Mhach alliance raids.<br>※Vexatious memories of the dying can be found from FATEs in the Far East region, or the Return to Ivalice alliance raids.",
        "You return to Gangos with an ample supply of memories for the node, which wastes no time in analyzing and allocating them. When you offer up your Resistance weapon, however, it warns of aetheric instability, and the near-certain corruption of your weapon should you proceed. Zlatan believes the solution to this problem lies in the crystal foci, which used a sealant of heated aetherial siltstone to ensure its stability. Regana notes there was a time when pottery made from this stone could be found in all corners of the realm, suggesting the ruins of Bozja may not be the only place where they can be found. Of course, there is only one among you capable of scouring such dark depths."

Thankfully, the Ironworks already has a plan of action, which Lilja is eager to explain.",

If all goes well, the <span class=\"emphasis\">Dalriada</span> will be disabled, perhaps giving Bajsaljen and his troops the edge needed to rout the imperials once and for all.",
        "Lilja has finished work on the D.A.M., and has even found the ideal location at which to set it. However, a number of final adjustments have to be made on-site, meaning that she must accompany you out onto the battlefield.",
        "While seeking a suitable spot to set the D.A.M., you are assaulted by a small unit of IVth Legion soldiers. They prove no match for your martial prowess, and it is not long before you and Lilja resume preparing the D.A.M.",
        "With the D.A.M. in place, the Resistance is ready to set their plan in motion. What they were not expecting, however, was for the <span class=\"emphasis\">Dalriada</span> to roar to life. Undeterred by the not-so-small setback of the imperial warship entering the fray, Cid succeeds in activating the aetherwave amplifier, and the <span class=\"emphasis\">Dalriada</span> is forced to make an emergency landing. The sight of this emboldens the Resistance, and so they prepare to press forward.",
        "The <span class=\"emphasis\">Dalriada</span> has been rendered inoperable, but it remains to be seen what armaments yet remain within. Even so, there may never come a finer opportunity for the Resistance to strike, and Bajsaljen intends to seize it. He asks that you accompany his troops into the warship, and at last put an end to the IVth Legion's schemes to control Bozja.<br><br>※Players may enter the Dalriada via the associated critical engagement.",
        "With Lyon and Menenius defeated, the IVth Legion's plans appear to have fallen to ruin. There is no time to revel in your victory, however, for the Allagan weapon, which lay dormant in the ship, breaks free from its confines. It takes to the sky and begins amassing energy to release in an attack of cataclysmic proportions. Before delivering its fatal blow to the people of Bozja, however, Queen Gunnhildr appears, her holy blade in hand. The two entities clash overhead, the ensuing explosion claiming both the Allagan weapon and the queen.",
        "The threat of the IVth Legion and their Allagan weapon is no more. You thought to speak with Bajsaljen, but Marsak informs you he has already returned to Gangos. After your many travails together, the Resistance leader would no doubt welcome you to reflect on this historic victory.",
        "You expect to find Bajsaljen in the midst of merrymaking, but instead he is already hard at work setting the foundation for a new Bozja. The myriad factions that comprised the Resistance originally came together out of necessity, but if all goes to plan, the dream of a united Bozja may very well soon become a reality.",
        "The fight for freedom is won, and now work to rebuild may begin in earnest. Only time will tell what manner of nation Bozja will become, but you have every confidence it will prove a beacon of peace and prosperity to which others will aspire."

Before long, the work is completed, and you find yourself the proud owner of a weapon the ancient Bozjans could only dream of, possessed of a strength that may very well rival that of Save the Queen. Zlatan wastes no time relaying the good news to Bajsaljen.<br><br>Interrupting the jubilant mood, Regana brings up the matter of their contract, claiming Rowena has doubled the asking price for the materials used in the forging of such weapons. To everyone's surprise, Rowena herself appears unexpectedly to refute those selfsame claims and thereby uncover Regana's extortion scheme. Her plans exposed, Regana fully expects her employment to be terminated, but Zlatan insists she stays on to fulfill the contract between the Resistance and the House of Splendors. Rowena consents to his request, and all present, save perhaps Gerolt, are pleased to see that their work will be allowed to continue.<br><br>Your work to perfect the Resistance weapon has enheartened Bajsaljen, for now the people of Bozja will at last have a shining beacon of hope under which they might rally."

The servant responds with deferent appreciation, and directs you towards their base of operations in a corner of the High Crucible.<br><br>※You may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest.",
        "Upon reaching the crafting station, the manservant departs to inform Lord Manderville of your arrival. Godbert appears in short order, and after providing you with a brief history of Manderville weaponry, introduces you to the third member of your crew: the legendary blacksmith, Gerolt. Various obstacles yet stand in the way of Godbert and the recreation of his ancestor's armaments, and your particular task will be to acquire a sufficient quantity of manderium meteorite. According to Gerolt, the sky rocks in question might be available from one of Rowena's lackeys, Jubrunnah, who has set up shop near the city aetheryte. Suspiciously convenient.",
        "You approach Jubrunnah, and find that the opportunistic merchant has a large quantity of meteorite pieces in stock. Gil is the preferred currency of collectors the world over, but not for Rowena's very special customer, oh no. It seems her agent has been instructed to charge you a sizable bounty of Allagan tomestones for each chunk of fantastically rare sky rock. And Gerolt will need three of them.",
        "You deliver the manderium meteorite to the waiting blacksmith, who wastes no time in beginning the oil extraction process. The inert results are disappointing, to say the least. Godbert chooses that moment to make his appearance, treating a dumbfounded Gerolt to an outrageously masculine display of alchemy which transforms the liquid into glowing Exalamanderville. With all the necessary components now in place, Gerolt takes up his hammer, and succeeds in forging what is apparently only the first iteration of your chosen Manderville weaponry. Further refinements, however, will have to wait until Godbert has deciphered the next passage of his ancestor's manual. For the moment, it seems you are free to spend your time as you see fit. Embroiled in another madcap case, perhaps...?"

According to his ancestor's manual, however, the true key to the process is something rather more intangible: a clarity achieved in the aftermath of an invigorating victory. Godbert claims to have already gained such battle-based enlightenment through his encounter with Doctor Lugae, and insists that Gerolt undergo his own form of martial meditation. You are to accompany the blacksmith to Windweft, where Godbert has prepared for him the perfect opponent.<br><br>※You may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest.",
        "Godbert introduces you to Gerolt's opponent: an adorable axe-wielding mammet. Despite his obvious advantage in size and strength, Gerolt loses the initial bout, but a generous application of Salamanderville empowers him to overcome the surprisingly agile automaton. Fired up by his win, the blacksmith can hardly wait to stoke the flames of his furnace. It seems you had best acquire the necessary materials swiftly, before the glow of victory fades...<br><br>※Chunks of complementary chondrite can be obtained from Jubrunnah at the aetheryte plaza in Radz–at–Han.",
        "You deliver the chunks of chondrite to Gerolt, and the world seems to grow dark as you anxiously await the outcome. When the hammering stops, however, you find yourself in possession of a successfully augmented Manderville masterpiece. Gerolt then inquires as to how long the entire refinement process is likely to take─a question to which Godbert has no present answer. In breaking the cipher, Godbert has realized that the manual is but the first part of an incomplete set, and that locating the remainder of Godbrand's instructions will be a quest unto itself. Until the continuation of the guide is found, you must content yourself with your as-yet-imperfect weaponry."

As he staggers off back to his anvil, Godbert entreats you to begin gathering the required quantity of achondrite before returning to his own various tasks.<br><br>※Chunks of amplifying achondrite can be obtained from Jubrunnah at the aetheryte plaza in Radz–at–Han.",
