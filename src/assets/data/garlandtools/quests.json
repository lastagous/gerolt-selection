        "Impressed with the work you have done for his guild, Jacke tasks you with looking into a group of suspicious individuals who have attracted the attention of his men in recent days. Travel to Wineport, where the dodgy types have been seen, and rendezvous with your fellow rogue, Perimu Haurimu.",
        "Perimu elaborates upon the target of your investigation─what little he has gleaned, at least─when your conversation is interrupted by the sound of a scream coming from within the town. Head into Wineport and investigate.",
        "You enter Wineport to find a milkmaid─the source of the scream─standing over the bodies of three ruffians. She explains that she was almost mugged, until the brutes turned upon each other in a drunken scuffle which incapacitated all of them. Finding her story a bit <span class=\"emphasis\">too</span> convenient, Perimu heads off east of Wineport to investigate. Follow your guildmate and see what he has found.",
        "Perimu finds a couple of farmhands lying on the ground, equipped with weapons and suffering from mortal wounds. Convinced more than ever that the innocent milkmaid is not what she appears to be, he heads off in pursuit. Accompany him to upper La Noscea and ascertain the girl's true identity.",
        "No sooner do you and Perimu happen upon the girl than are you ambushed by an eccentric Easterner clad in red. A comrade of the girl's arrives, and the would-be assailant retreats, strongly implying that you've not seen the last of him. Conversing with the two reveals them as Oboro and Tsubame, <span class=\"emphasis\">shinobi</span> from the Far Eastern land of Doma, come to bring their traitorous countryman─the man named Karasu─to justice. Upon seeing the soul of his fallen brother respond to your touch, Oboro offers to instruct you in the art of his people in exchange for information that might assist him in his mission. Should you care to take him up on his offer, seek him out at the Raincatcher Gully docks.",
        "Oboro is heartened by your arrival, and invites you to step inside the storehouse where the two of you may speak in private. He gives you the necessary password: when the gatekeep Byakubu speaks <span class=\"emphasis\">Ayame</span>, you are to answer <span class=\"emphasis\">Kaede</span>.",
        "Your pronunciation of the Doman language seems to have satisfied Byakubu, who grants you passage into the ninja hideout. Speak with Oboro, who awaits you within.",
        "Oboro expresses his gratitude for your cooperation, and gives you a brief summary of the ancient art passed down among his people for generations. As he tells it, the art─called <span class=\"emphasis\">ninjutsu</span>─involves channeling the powers of heaven, earth, and man, given physical form through the use of hand gestures known as <span class=\"emphasis\">mudra</span>. He teaches you your first mudra, <span class=\"emphasis\">Ten</span>, and invites you to attune yourself to the soul of his brother and speak with him again to commence your training."

As such a shipment would arouse suspicion at the docks, he has arranged for the goods to be delivered to the De Nevelle Checkpoint in middle La Noscea.",

To this end, he has entrusted the various pieces to four of his “shadows” that he has deemed expendable. You are to traverse the land and defeat each in single combat to earn what you would claim as yours. Your first challenge awaits at the Red Rooster Stead.",

        "Oboro teaches you four new mudra combinations that you can form with your newfound knowledge, but sadly lacks the time to explain, let alone demonstrate the precise nature of their effects and how they will serve you in battle. The task at hand is to see to Tsubame's safety. Return to the dock storehouse where Oboro awaits!",
        "You return to the docks to see signs that a battle was fought in your absence. Tsubame is missing, but Oboro suspects she is close by. Find her and attend to her wounds if she is injured as Oboro fears.",
        "As suspected, you find Tsubame in the clutches of Karasu, who while flogging her to near death, has seemingly seen fit to spare her life. Oboro utterly loses control of his emotions, turning against his foe in a blind, frenzied rage, which seems to please Karasu all the more. Suggesting that this is what he had hoped to see in his rival, the traitor agrees to a battle to the death─a battle in which Oboro and you prove victorious. Oboro is about to claim Karasu's life when your flamboyant foe spins a curious tale that suggests the true traitor of Doma was none other than the trusted teacher of the two shinobi, Master Gekkai. Oboro scoffs, dismissing Karasu's words as pathetic lies, but his expression betrays a heart in turmoil. Karasu cryptically reveals the name of a single location─Candlekeep Quay─before taking to the air and self-immolating in a burst of glory as his rival stands there nonplussed. Speak with Oboro and see how he has handled this unexpected turn of events.",

Give your teacher time to work through his crisis of confidence as you hone your ninjutsu skills to new heights.<br><br>※The next ninja quest will be available from Oboro upon reaching level 50."

As a final favor, he has asked you to watch over the recovering Tsubame while he pays one last visit to the place in Eorzea most special to him.",
        "Tsubame's wounds have healed impressively, leading her to surmise that Karasu manipulated his attack on her primarily for visual effect. She is more concerned for Oboro, who she feels is hiding his true feelings from her. Seek him out at his favorite Eorzean haunt, Fool Falls in upper La Noscea.",
        "Initially taken aback at your presence, Oboro soon confesses his true feelings to you. His battle with Karasu has left the shinobi a changed man. No longer willing or able to repress his true self, he has chosen to forsake obligation in favor of following his own heart's desire, which urges him to seek out the truth behind the traitor he hunted for so long. Prepared to face the answer he fears the most, he has resolved to undertake this final mission alone, insisting that Tsubame and you have sacrificed enough on his behalf. No sooner does he leave than Tsubame steps out from the shadows, looking very concerned at his words.",
        "Oboro's words confirm Tsubame's worst fear: that he means to seek out and confront Master Gekkai alone, even if it means sacrificing his life. She explains that she, too, has come to a resolution─to fight at Oboro's side─and has no intention of being denied. Recalling the dying Karasu's last words, Tsubame suggests that you make for Candlekeep Quay and question the guards about any happenings of note in the area.",
        "According to Zahrmerl, everything is quiet on the quay, save for talk of a small private vessel scheduled to arrive in port at the break of dawn. Though it appears that Oboro is already in the area, Tsubame deems it too dangerous to search for him and attempt to make contact at this time, preferring to observe the area from a safe distance until Master Gekkai shows himself. Take up position on the promontory above the quay and keep lookout for any suspicious movements.",
        "Karasu's tale─Oboro's worst fears─is confirmed as true when the Garlean espionage unit commander who sailed into Candlekeep Quay is indeed revealed to be none other than Master Gekkai. Confronted by his former pupil, Gekkai shows no remorse, coolly explaining how he made a simple decision to seek out a stronger master, while at the same time guaranteeing the safety of his village over that of countless Doman commonfolk that were of no import to him. Incensed by his one-time master's callous disdain for the nation he called home, Oboro draws his blade and swears vengeance, and together you, he, and Tsubame defeat the shinobi master. After the battle, Karasu returns from his self-staged death to bequeath to you the final piece of your ninja garb, and to Oboro the soul crystal that will allow him to go home to a hero's welcome, before walking off to parts unknown. His long mission finally at an end, Oboro returns to the dock storehouse. Meet him there to say your farewells.",
        "Upon returning to the storehouse, Oboro imparts to you a final ninjutsu technique, Kassatsu. While the two shinobi initially intended to return home together, Oboro has decided to remain behind to continue his study of Eorzean culture, in hopes of bringing new schools of thought back to his home. From your experiences traveling with Oboro and Tsubame and fighting at their side, it would seem that the future of the village is in good hands.<br><br>※The next ninja quest will be available from Oboro once you have completed the main scenario quest “Before the Dawn.”"

He remembers that taking on missions in service of Doma honed his own skills, and wonders if perhaps you, too, are wanting for duty. Luckily, Jacke has recently asked for Oboro's presence in some urgent matter. Accompany your erstwhile mentor to the Rogues' Guild.",
        "According to Jacke, there is a bandit in Far Eastern garb going about robbing people, and, even more concerning, using ninjutsu in the process. After checking a slightly disgruntled Oboro, the guildmaster asks that you both aid him in tracking the thief. Follow him to Summerford Farms, and there interview the victim, Mulfa Kelfa.",
        "The distraught merchant tells you his sad tale of how two thieves stole his one rare and oh-so-expensive Far Eastern orb. Learning that the criminals headed northwest, Jacke proposes that you immediately give chase, that you might track them down before they have a chance to escape with their ill-gotten goods. Begin by traveling to where they were last seen, just outside Summerford Farms.",
        "You find a trail of footprints leading northwest. Follow them on the path across the bridge, towards the Descent.",
        "The footprints continue to the northwest. Climb down the wooden stairs, and see again where they lead.",
        "You see the faint outlines of two figures near the entrance of Woad Whisper Canyon to the northeast. Head in that direction, and be ready for anything.",
        "You corner a strange girl along the cliffs, who answers Jacke's questions by silently drawing her blades. Before you come to blows, however, Mulfa Kelfa arrives. He thanks you for your service, and then asks his bodyguard to kill you. Apparently, it would not do for you to learn how he acquired the orb. Unfortunately for him, you, Jacke, and Oboro make short work of his hired blade. The strange girl grudgingly thanks you for your aid. Oboro marks her for a person from the Far East, at which point her retainer, Akagi, introduces her as Princess Yuki Yatsurugi. She left her lands in search of treasures stolen from her clan. Oboro presumptuously offers her your aid, but she refuses, calling all shinobi traitors. Akagi, however, is more accommodating to Oboro's proposal, and promises to contact you should Yuki ever be found in danger. Return now to the dock storehouse, and hear Oboro's thoughts on the matter.",
        "Oboro tells you that the princess's skills are famed in the Far East, and that she may have little need of your help. However, you have now promised your blade to her, and so must train both it and your mind so that you can protect her, no matter what may come.<br><br>※The next ninja quest will be available from Oboro upon reaching level 52."

The siblings remain steadfast in their resolve to spread the teachings of their people across Eorzea, although Broken Mountain seems reluctant to take up the axe once more. Instead, he now pursues more scholarly studies─during which he has stumbled upon information regarding ancient martial techniques. If you would know more of such things, make your way to Camp Bronze Lake and speak with Broken Mountain.",
        "Broken Mountain tells you of a legendary hero named Mythril Heart whose combat prowess is detailed at length in accounts he has discovered. Skeptical of their veracity, he sees no point in studying them further. However, Curious Gorge strongly believes otherwise, and even his old comrade-in-arms Wheiskaet seems to think there may be truth in them as well. Yielding to pressure, Broken Mountain states that he will reconsider his stance if you uncover proof that Mythril Heart was real. Recalling that the hero's final journey took him to Silvertear Falls, Curious Gorge suggests that you speak with the Sons of Saint Coinach, who conduct their research in Mor Dhona.",
        "Though none of the researchers know of Mythril Heart, it becomes clear that artifacts not of Allagan origin are often left untouched. Scour the shores of Silvertear Falls and see if you can find proof that the Hellsguard hero once walked these lands.",
        "As if by fate, you come upon an axe that is quite unremarkable outside of the crudely engraved letters “MH” on its haft. Could it be the weapon once wielded by the legendary Mythril Heart? Present it to Broken Mountain and see if it serves as proof that the stories were not mere faerie tales.",
        "Broken Mountain declares the weapon to be that of the legendary Mythril Heart, proving that the stories he discovered were true. Convinced of the hero's existence, he agrees to resume his studies of the ancient tomes in order to unlock the secrets of Mythril Heart's techniques─though he also acknowledges that the techniques are like to rouse the inner beast like none before.<br><br>※The next warrior quest will be available from Broken Mountain upon reaching level 52."

As you land your final blow, your own inner beast rouses from its slumber with such ferocity that you lose consciousness momentarily. Afterwards, Broken Mountain forbids his brother from assisting you further in your quest, for fear of him losing control again. Though clearly distressed, Curious Gorge accepts his brother's judgment. Rest and visit Broken Mountain in Camp Bronze Lake when you are ready to continue your conversation.",

Even though he wants nothing more than to improve, it seems his fear of losing control once again is keeping him from fighting with all his strength. In order to serve as an example to Curious Gorge, and future warriors, Broken Mountain tells you to follow in Mythril Heart's footsteps by hunting the fearsome grizzly bears inhabiting Abalathia's Spine. Go to Tailfeather in the Dravanian forelands and ask the hunters there for any information that might help you track down these colossal creatures.",
        "The hunters at Tailfeather share stories of the massive grizzlies, none of them encouraging. One hunter begrudgingly informs you that some have been known to lure the bears out with Whilom salmon, which can be found at the northwestern part of the Whilom River. Go to the riverbanks and gather any fish you can find.",
        "The hunter's advice was sound, and you have found enough fish to draw one of the beasts out from hiding. Go to the Hundred Throes and use the Whilom salmon to draw a grizzly out, then slay one of them in its watering hole.",
        "You have defeated a fearsome Whilom grizzly, as Mythril Heart before you, and the pitched battle awakens your inner beast from its slumber. Return to Camp Bronze Lake and inform Broken Mountain of your deeds.",
        "Upon returning to Camp Bronze Lake, Curious Gorge enthusiastically informs you of the Maelstrom's successful defense against the kobold attacks, and returns to train for his next mission. However, Wheiskaet has a different story. Although the operation succeeded, it seems Curious Gorge remains frightened of losing control in battle. With the beast tribes growing bolder by the day, there is little hope for the Maelstrom to take warriors seriously if Curious Gorge continues to underperform. Broken Mountain will continue to do research into how to tame the inner beast and encourages you to continue your training in preparation for the next step.<br><br>※The next warrior quest will be available from Broken Mountain upon reaching level 56."

He has requested that you aid him in the defense of Limsa Lominsa, and promises fierce battles that will test even <span class=\"emphasis\">your</span> battle-worn axe. Report to Aleport and speak with the storm captain for details of your mission.",
        "The storm captain begins the mission briefing, informing you that the Serpent Reavers plan to mount an offensive from the sea, using the Isles of Umbra as a foothold. Determining that the best course of action is to scatter the pirates before they have a chance to carry out their attack, he instructs you to make haste to the isles. Speak with the captain once you have landed ashore the Isles of Umbra.",

        "Although several allies have fallen to the Reavers' blades, you manage to cut through their next line of defense. The storm captain's face has a look of desperate determination─speak with him to find out where the next step of pirate killing begins.",
        "The remnants of the Maelstrom outfit have suffered through several waves of relentless Serpent Reavers, but the pirate encampment is finally in sight. Speak with the storm captain once more before proceeding.",
        "The Serpent Reaver captain is in sight, with his ferocious beast in tow. Save the storm captain from the pirate's barrage and steel yourself for the final battle.",
        "The Reaver captain and his pet monster are no match for a warrior who follows in the path of Mythril Heart. Rescue the storm captain and scatter the last remnants of the Serpent Reavers.",
        "You've rescued the storm captain, who expresses his gratitude for your help in repelling the Serpent Reavers. However, he is hesitant to remain on the Isles of Umbra for a second longer than he has to, and bids the party meet up again at Aleport. Speak with the storm captain again once everyone is safely out of those haunted isles.",
        "The morale and strength the troops gained from your presence was key to your victory, and despite the relative weakness of the Serpent Reavers, the souls of the warriors' ancestors bestow upon you a new technique, indicating that the resolve to defend your allies is just as effective as resolving to kill your enemies. After you have recovered from your ordeal, speak with the captain again."

        "Broken Mountain has something urgent to discuss with you.",
        "Broken Mountain, impressed with your progress, gives word that the Maelstrom is once again in need of extra bodies to aid in another operation against the beast tribes. Wheiskaet and Curious Gorge have visited Camp Bronze Lake seeking volunteers, and have asked for you by name. Speak with Curious Gorge to hear what it is Limsa Lominsa requires.",
        "Wheiskaet informs you that Maelstrom scouts have reported that kobolds of the 179th Order are tirelessly producing bombs in preparation for an all-out assault on Camp Bronze Lake. Maelstrom troops hope to intercept the bombs at Zelma's Run before they can do any damage, and Wheiskaet asks the aid of the two fiercest warriors he knows. Once again, Curious Gorge is afraid of his inner beast taking hold, especially in such a confined area, but Broken Mountain insists that this will be the ideal situation for Gorge to establish his dominance over the beast within. Curious Gorge asks to be alone and leaves, while Wheiskaet gives you the details of the Maelstrom operation. Speak with the despondent Curious Gorge once more before heading off to Zelma's Run and see if he can be convinced to join in on the fight.",
        "You find Curious Gorge looking crestfallen in one of the camp's hot springs. He admits that his brother is right, and that the correct path is plain, but can't seem to shake his fear of being overcome by the inner beast. He comes up with a last, desperate strategy: you must /slap him with all the strength you can muster, hopefully driving the cowardice from him for good.",
        "Your slap rouses Curious Gorge out of his slump, and he stands straight as if a warrior reborn. Determined to show the kobolds no quarter, he rushes to meet the storm captain at Zelma's Run. Follow him and rendezvous with the rest of the troops. Speak with the storm captain when you are ready to start the Maelstrom's next operation.",
        "You arrive at the entrance to Zelma's Run to see the same storm captain from your operation against the Serpent Reavers along with two other Maelstrom troops and Curious Gorge, who is dressed proudly in his warrior's garb. You have been assigned to intercept the 179th Order kobolds on the east side of the valley. Ready your axe and speak with the Maelstrom troop at your assigned area, but be on the lookout for any signs of kobolds.",
        "In his haste, the storm private assigned as your partner falls victim to a kobold ambush. When you run to his aid, the kobolds attempt to swarm you and the storm private, but your axe cuts them down one after the other. With the kobolds of the 179th Order slain or scattered, check on the storm private to see that his wounds are not severe.",
        "The storm private's wounds are but light, and there are no remaining kobolds in sight. The defense of the eastern side of Zelma's Run is a success. Check with Curious Gorge to the west for news of their progress.",
        "It seems Curious Gorge and the other Maelstrom troops had no trouble in intercepting and dispatching the kobolds on the western side of Zelma's Run. The storm captain gives particular credit to Curious Gorge's ferocity in battle, and promises to give high praise in his report to Maelstrom Command. After the others return home, Curious Gorge tells you he was finally able to fight with abandon without succumbing to his inner beast. Nevertheless, he still doubts his own ability to maintain control in a more pitched battle. Curious Gorge returns to Camp Bronze Lake to rest, and asks you to give word of your victory to Broken Mountain upon your return.",
        "Broken Mountain is pleased that his brother was able to fight to his fullest, but disheartened by the news of his brother's continuing self-doubt. There is little time to consider the matter, however, as Wheiskaet brings news that Storm Marshal Slafyrsyn is seeking the aid of capable warriors to help defend Limsa Lominsa from the Sahagin menace. Broken Mountain suggests that if you were to succeed in this operation, it might lift the reputation of the warriors out of obscurity and into Eorzean history books. Continue your training in preparation for what promises to be the most critical test of your strength yet.<br><br>※The next warrior quest will be available from Broken Mountain upon reaching level 60."

        "Broken Mountain informs you that the Sahagin have begun their assault on the tidegates. Although Curious Gorge remains doubtful about his ability to control his inner beast, the defense will require two warriors for it to be successful. Broken Mountain will not let you and his brother shoulder all of the burden, however, and he informs you that he will aid you with what limited healing magicks he has at his disposal. Speak with Curious Gorge for further details of the defensive operation.",
        "The three burly Roegadyn fighters are ready to depart for the decisive battle. Wheiskaet informs you that the Sahagin plan to use massive seabeasts to overrun the tidegate, and that he will be joining you despite the wounds he suffered in his fight with the primal Titan. Curious Gorge, still overcome with self-doubt, asks you to once again dispel the fear from his heart with an inspiring /slap to the face.",
        "Your slap serves to rouse Curious Gorge's inner beast even more so than his fight with the kobolds, restoring his confidence and preparing him for his fight against the Sahagin threat. With a newfound courage, he rushes to Camp Skull Valley─follow him and speak with Storm Commander Falkbryda to receive a briefing on your critical mission.",
        "Your allies are all waiting at the southern gate for the fury of the Sahagin. Speak with Storm Marshal Eynzahr to start the desperate battle.",
        "The Sahagin come in waves, one after the other, only to be cut down like fish to the slaughter. Curious Gorge fights at a fever pitch, eventually falling to the ground in a struggle to control his inner beast. In the last desperate moment, he triumphantly quells the rising fury of his inner beast, at last conquering it for good. Then, in a futile attempt to break through the tidegate's mighty defenders, the Sahagin captain attacks with his massive seabeast, but they fall quickly before the full strength of two unbridled warriors. With the Sahagin threat finally quelled, speak with Curious Gorge to celebrate this tremendous victory together.",
        "Curious Gorge and his brother are ecstatic that the former was able to finally tame his inner beast, but that is not the only good news waiting for them. With the Sahagin threat quelled, Storm Marshal Eynzahr informs them that the Maelstrom will move forward with its plan to train its troops in the way of the warrior, and that Maelstrom Command has requested that the two brothers be the first two to teach the fledgling warriors. Little by little, the dream that they carried down with them from their humble mountain village will come to pass, as more people of Eorzea learn the teachings of their ancestors. Curious Gorge, fueled by his new confidence, swears that he will master the techniques of eld, and promises a fearsome duel once you both reach the peak of your martial prowess. Take care not to neglect your training, lest one day Curious Gorge become the mightiest warrior in Eorzea.<br><br>※The next warrior quest will be available from Curious Gorge once you have completed the main scenario quest “The Far Edge of Fate.”"

For the showdown, he has chosen Snowcloak in Coerthas─but before you can offer your assistance, he commands you to stay away and find a safe haven. Jenlyns also mentions that Solkzagyl wishes to speak with you, and the captain directs you to a tunnel in central Thanalan where Solkzagyl will be waiting.",

Together, the three of you manage to defeat the assassins and deal the Monetarists a crushing blow. Afterwards, despite the captain's objections, Solkzagyl leaves the Sultansworn in Jenlyns's hands and returns to his paladin's journey. Return to Ul'dah, find Jenlyns at his station near the Royal Promenade in the Hustings Strip, and talk to him once more.",

In recognition of your deeds, he bestows upon you the gallant surcoat, sacred armor normally reserved for the most courageous of the Sultansworn. Although this is a violation of long-standing tradition, he believes there is no paladin more deserving of the honor. Wear your new armor with pride, free paladin, and continue to defend the people of Eorzea.<br><br>※The next paladin quest will be available from Jenlyns once you have completed the main scenario quest “Before the Dawn.”"

To locate three of the pieces, pour the blood of Kazagg Chah into the planar fissure at the Zanr'ak encampment in southern Thanalan, the blood of Dozol Meloc into the planar fissure at the Ixali logging grounds in the North Shroud, and the blood of Da Za into the planar fissure at O'Ghomoro in outer La Noscea.",

Alas, all have returned disappointed, as Jehantel offers only to teach poetry and verse.

In order to guarantee your supremacy in summoning, the researcher appears eager to conduct the Austerities of Wind─a ritual that requires the captured aetheric essence of the Lady of the Vortex. While Y'mhitra seeks an appropriate place to call forth the wind-aspected egi, she bids you make certain of your own preparations.<br><br>※The next summoner quest will be available from Y'mhitra upon the successful defeat of the primal Garuda."

Alas, the Nymian tablets he purchased were stolen en route to Limsa Lominsa. Journey to the Raincatcher Gully docks in eastern La Noscea, where he suspects the thieves may be found, and help him recover his stolen relics.",

However, Alka Zolka had not anticipated the appearance of an otherworldly creature, one which seemingly burst forth from a crystal you found with the tablets.

Ask the shocked marauder what he would like to do next.",

        "Alka Zolka has news which should be of great interest to you.",
        "Alka Zolka has come into possession of ancient engravings which purport to show the traditional raiments of Nymian scholars. Coupled with information gleaned from other sources, he believes he has deduced the raiments' design. However, he wishes to conclusively verify their historical accuracy by recreating the garments and gauging your faerie's reaction. In order to do so, he will need to enlist the aid of a preeminent Eorzean weaver─namely, Master Redolent Rose of Sunsilk Tapestries. Approaching him now would be premature, though, as you must first gather the leaves of a direwort. These plants, which can be found only in the Fogfens of Mor Dhona, are essential for producing the distinct colors of a Nymian scholar's uniform.",
        "Your initial attempt to gather the direwort leaves is foiled by the sudden appearance of belligerent wildlife, which you are forced to dispatch. Hopefully, your second attempt will not be so rudely interrupted.",
        "To your relief, no rampaging beast attempts to devour you this time. Journey to Ul'dah and speak with Redolent Rose, who should have hopefully been contacted by Alka Zolka by now.",
        "Redolent Rose works feverishly to render the ancient designs into modern creations. Alas, his skill is insufficient to produce more than the culottes; the other pieces will require the skills of a master goldsmith and leatherworker. Realizing that you were not aware of this fact, Redolent Rose offers to contact Mistresses Serendipity and Geva of the Goldsmiths' and Leatherworkers' Guilds on your behalf, so that you need only visit each guild and present the items to receive their help.",
        "The ever-cheerful Serendipity requires but a moment to fashion a mythril tassel for your mortarboard. You can only hope that Geva will work with similar alacrity.",
        "Geva effortlessly crafts a pair of fingerless gloves in accordance with Alka Zolka's designs. However, she has no intention of spoiling you further, and bids you speak with Beli, her subordinate, about the boots.",
        "Beli relishes the opportunity to finish the famed Redolent Rose's work, wasting no time in constructing the leather boots. Now that the set is complete, all that remains is to show Alka Zolka what the craftsmen have wrought.",
        "Alka Zolka is thrilled by the resemblance you bear to the Nymian scholars of eld. He is not alone in his excitement, as your faerie also appears to approve of your new raiments. Wear them with pride as you continue to pursue your studies."

Determined not to repeat the mistakes of the past, Alka Zolka has enlisted the aid of two other marauders. He would also like you to join as well─but only if you can promise to keep your faerie in check. If you can, rendezvous with him and the others in Bronze Lake, at the same ruins where you fought the first tonberry.",
        "You pursue the tonberry to the Wanderer's Palace, leaving many of its brethren slain in your wake. As the creature grows weaker, Alka Zolka once again raises his axe to deliver the final blow─and once again is prevented from doing so by your faerie. At last understanding her intent, the two of you turn your restorative magicks upon the tonberry. Rejuvenated, it rises to its feet, and reveals that it was once a man named Surito Carito, one of countless Nymians transformed by a mysterious sickness, and imprisoned within the Wanderer's Palace by their own countrymen. Like his fellow Nymians, Surito was driven mad by his fate─until you returned with his dear companion Lily and cleansed him of his rancor. This shocking revelation has doubtless affected the marauders, so it may be wise to see how they are faring.",

        "Alas, the sickness which transformed Surito Carito has rendered him incapable of summoning Lily. By what providence you came to possess his Soul of the Scholar he does not know, but he is nevertheless pleased to see his dear companion in good hands. Declaring that only you are fit to wield the magicks now, he bequeaths to you a scholar's gown, as well as knowledge of the spell Sacred Soil. He then bids you farewell, embarking on a quest to rid his countrymen of their rancor. Carry on the traditions of your Nymian colleagues and share your scholarly gifts with the people of Eorzea!<br><br>※The next scholar quest will be available from Alka Zolka once you have completed the main scenario quest “Before the Dawn.”"

Even as he declares his work over, however, the man believes that there is still something incomplete about it. In order to shed light upon the mystery, Gerolt suggests that you seek out literature surrounding the hero associated with the relic. Perhaps the trader Rowena back at Revenant's Toll will be able to assist you in this endeavor.",

In the meantime, you are to familiarize yourself with the restored weapon in its current state. Arm yourself with the unfinished Bravura, make your way to U'Ghamaro Mines in outer La Noscea, and there slay eight U'Ghamaro quarrymen, eight U'Ghamaro roundsmen, and eight U'Ghamaro bedesmen.",

To this end, he bids you challenge the hydra within Halatali, the abandoned training grounds situated in eastern Thanalan.

        "You have obtained the timeworn Curtana. Make your way back to Hyrstmill and present the relic to Gerolt.",
        "According to Gerolt, the restoration process involves merging the old with the new─that is, embedding the original relic in a new host weapon. To this end, you must bring him an aeolian scimitar melded with two grade three battledance materia.",
        "You have delivered the materia-enhanced aeolian scimitar to Gerolt. The weaponsmith next directs you to go to the Weeping Saint in the Coerthas central highlands, and obtain alumina salts from the dhorme chimera.<br><br>※The dhorme chimera can be confronted via the Duty Finder upon examining the quest destination.<br>※This objective must be completed as a paladin.",
        "You have painstakingly obtained the pinch of alumina salts. Make your way back to Hyrstmill and deliver it to Gerolt.",
        "Using the alumina salts you brought him, Gerolt adds the finishing touches to your relic weapon. Even as he declares his work over, however, the man believes that there is still something incomplete about it. In order to shed light upon the mystery, Gerolt suggests that you seek out literature surrounding the hero associated with the relic. Perhaps the trader Rowena back at Revenant's Toll will be able to assist you in this endeavor.",
        "You have consulted Rowena, who agrees to procure the literature you seek...for a price. For your part of the deal, you must obtain for her an Amdapor glyph. Make your way through Amdapor Keep in the South Shroud, and procure this artifact.<br><br>※Amdapor Keep can be accessed via the Duty Finder.<br>※This objective must be completed as a paladin.",

        "After a cursory examination of the text, Gerolt declares that he will require some time to make sense of its contents. In the meantime, you are to familiarize yourself with the restored weapon in its current state. Arm yourself with the unfinished Curtana, make your way to Zahar'ak in southern Thanalan, and there slay eight Zahar'ak lancers, eight Zahar'ak pugilists, and eight Zahar'ak thaumaturges.",
        "You have defeated the specified Amalj'aa. Return to Hyrstmill and report your success to Gerolt.",
        "Upon your return, Gerolt deduces that you must face mightier adversaries if you are to experience a revelation pertaining to your relic. To this end, he bids you challenge the hydra within Halatali, the abandoned training grounds situated in eastern Thanalan. Armed with the unfinished Curtana, enter Halatali and defeat the hydra.<br><br>※The hydra can be confronted via the Duty Finder upon examining the quest destination.",
        "You have overcome the hydra. Take word of your accomplishment back to Gerolt at Hyrstmill.",

        "Gerolt declares that but one step remains in the restoration. In order to create the raging fire that he needs, the weaponsmith bids you fetch him a white-hot ember, a howling gale, and a chunk of hyperfused ore. The first of these can be obtained by defeating Ifrit within the Bowl of Embers (Hard).<br><br>※The Bowl of Embers (Hard) can be accessed via the Duty Finder.<br>※This objective must be completed as a paladin.",

        "You have delivered the three items Gerolt requires to create a raging fire. Now he only wants for a bottle of Radz–at–Han quenching oil to complete the restoration of your relic. Obtain this item and deliver it to the weaponsmith.",
        "You have delivered the bottle of Radz–at–Han quenching oil to Gerolt, who promptly sees to the final stage of the restoration process. After no small amount of effort and perseverance, you are now the proud owner of Curtana. May it serve you well in your adventures to come!"

For the first step, the weaponsmith bids you venture within Zahar'ak in southern Thanalan to retrieve the lost pair of Sphairai. Search for a vessel in which the valuable relic might be kept.",
        "You have obtained the pair of timeworn Sphairai. Make your way back to Hyrstmill and present the relic to Gerolt.",
        "According to Gerolt, the restoration process involves merging the old with the new─that is, embedding the original relic in a new host weapon. To this end, you must bring him a pair of wildling's cesti melded with two grade three savage aim materia.",
        "You have delivered the materia-enhanced wildling's cesti to Gerolt. The weaponsmith next directs you to go to the Weeping Saint in the Coerthas central highlands, and obtain alumina salts from the dhorme chimera.<br><br>※The dhorme chimera can be confronted via the Duty Finder upon examining the quest destination.<br>※This objective must be completed as a monk.",
        "You have painstakingly obtained the pinch of alumina salts. Make your way back to Hyrstmill and deliver it to Gerolt.",
        "Using the alumina salts you brought him, Gerolt adds the finishing touches to your relic weapon. Even as he declares his work over, however, the man believes that there is still something incomplete about it. In order to shed light upon the mystery, Gerolt suggests that you seek out literature surrounding the hero associated with the relic. Perhaps the trader Rowena back at Revenant's Toll will be able to assist you in this endeavor.",
        "You have consulted Rowena, who agrees to procure the literature you seek...for a price. For your part of the deal, you must obtain for her an Amdapor glyph. Make your way through Amdapor Keep in the South Shroud, and procure this artifact.<br><br>※Amdapor Keep can be accessed via the Duty Finder.<br>※This objective must be completed as a monk.",
        "You have successfully obtained an Amdapor glyph. Make your way back to Revenant's Toll and deliver it to Rowena.",
        "You give the Amdapor glyph to Rowena, who upholds her promise and furnishes you a copy of <span class=\"emphasis\">Enter the Coeurl</span>. You now possess literature on the hero who once wielded the relic weapon. Gerolt the weaponsmith will be keen to peruse it.",
        "After a cursory examination of the text, Gerolt declares that he will require some time to make sense of its contents. In the meantime, you are to familiarize yourself with the restored weapon in its current state. Arm yourself with the pair of unfinished Sphairai, make your way to Zahar'ak in southern Thanalan, and there slay eight Zahar'ak lancers, eight Zahar'ak pugilists, and eight Zahar'ak archers.",
        "You have defeated the specified Amalj'aa. Return to Hyrstmill and report your success to Gerolt.",
        "Upon your return, Gerolt deduces that you must face mightier adversaries if you are to experience a revelation pertaining to your relic. To this end, he bids you challenge the hydra within Halatali, the abandoned training grounds situated in eastern Thanalan. Armed with the pair of unfinished Sphairai, enter Halatali and defeat the hydra.<br><br>※The hydra can be confronted via the Duty Finder upon examining the quest destination.",
        "You have overcome the hydra. Take word of your accomplishment back to Gerolt at Hyrstmill.",
        "Combining information gleaned from the text with your firsthand experience, Gerolt has ascertained what must be done next. Hand over the pair of unfinished Sphairai to the weaponsmith.",
        "Gerolt declares that but one step remains in the restoration. In order to create the raging fire that he needs, the weaponsmith bids you fetch him a white-hot ember, a howling gale, and a chunk of hyperfused ore. The first of these can be obtained by defeating Ifrit within the Bowl of Embers (Hard).<br><br>※The Bowl of Embers (Hard) can be accessed via the Duty Finder.<br>※This objective must be completed as a monk.",
        "You have extinguished the Lord of the Inferno and obtained a white-hot ember. Next, take on Garuda in the Howling Eye (Hard) and defeat her to obtain a howling gale.<br><br>※The Howling Eye (Hard) can be accessed via the Duty Finder.<br>※This objective must be completed as a monk.",

        "You have buried the Lord of Crags and obtained a chunk of hyperfused ore. Deliver it along with the white-hot ember and the howling gale to Gerolt.",
        "You have delivered the three items Gerolt requires to create a raging fire. Now he only wants for a bottle of Radz–at–Han quenching oil to complete the restoration of your relic. Obtain this item and deliver it to the weaponsmith.",
        "You have delivered the bottle of Radz–at–Han quenching oil to Gerolt, who promptly sees to the final stage of the restoration process. After no small amount of effort and perseverance, you are now the proud owner of the pair of Sphairai. May it serve you well in your adventures to come!"

        "Gerolt has the air of a man defeated.",
        "Gerolt has reluctantly agreed to lend his expertise to the restoration of a legendary arm of yore. For the first step, the weaponsmith bids you venture within Natalan in the Coerthas central highlands to retrieve the lost Gae Bolg. Search for a vessel in which the valuable relic might be kept.",
        "You have obtained the timeworn Gae Bolg. Make your way back to Hyrstmill and present the relic to Gerolt.",
        "According to Gerolt, the restoration process involves merging the old with the new─that is, embedding the original relic in a new host weapon. To this end, you must bring him a champion's lance melded with two grade three savage aim materia.",
        "You have delivered the materia-enhanced champion's lance to Gerolt. The weaponsmith next directs you to go to the Weeping Saint in the Coerthas central highlands, and obtain alumina salts from the dhorme chimera.<br><br>※The dhorme chimera can be confronted via the Duty Finder upon examining the quest destination.<br>※This objective must be completed as a dragoon.",
        "You have painstakingly obtained the pinch of alumina salts. Make your way back to Hyrstmill and deliver it to Gerolt.",
        "Using the alumina salts you brought him, Gerolt adds the finishing touches to your relic weapon. Even as he declares his work over, however, the man believes that there is still something incomplete about it. In order to shed light upon the mystery, Gerolt suggests that you seek out literature surrounding the hero associated with the relic. Perhaps the trader Rowena back at Revenant's Toll will be able to assist you in this endeavor.",
        "You have consulted Rowena, who agrees to procure the literature you seek...for a price. For your part of the deal, you must obtain for her an Amdapor glyph. Make your way through Amdapor Keep in the South Shroud, and procure this artifact.<br><br>※Amdapor Keep can be accessed via the Duty Finder.<br>※This objective must be completed as a dragoon.",
        "You have successfully obtained an Amdapor glyph. Make your way back to Revenant's Toll and deliver it to Rowena.",
        "You give the Amdapor glyph to Rowena, who upholds her promise and furnishes you a copy of <span class=\"emphasis\">The Book of Reinette</span>. You now possess literature on the hero who once wielded the relic weapon. Gerolt the weaponsmith will be keen to peruse it.",
        "After a cursory examination of the text, Gerolt declares that he will require some time to make sense of its contents. In the meantime, you are to familiarize yourself with the restored weapon in its current state. Arm yourself with the unfinished Gae Bolg, make your way to Natalan in the Coerthas central highlands, and there slay eight Natalan boldwings, eight Natalan fogcallers, and eight Natalan swiftbeaks.",
        "You have defeated the specified Ixal. Return to Hyrstmill and report your success to Gerolt.",
        "Upon your return, Gerolt deduces that you must face mightier adversaries if you are to experience a revelation pertaining to your relic. To this end, he bids you challenge the hydra within Halatali, the abandoned training grounds situated in eastern Thanalan. Armed with the unfinished Gae Bolg, enter Halatali and defeat the hydra.<br><br>※The hydra can be confronted via the Duty Finder upon examining the quest destination.",
        "You have overcome the hydra. Take word of your accomplishment back to Gerolt at Hyrstmill.",
        "Combining information gleaned from the text with your firsthand experience, Gerolt has ascertained what must be done next. Hand over the unfinished Gae Bolg to the weaponsmith.",
        "Gerolt declares that but one step remains in the restoration. In order to create the raging fire that he needs, the weaponsmith bids you fetch him a white-hot ember, a howling gale, and a chunk of hyperfused ore. The first of these can be obtained by defeating Ifrit within the Bowl of Embers (Hard).<br><br>※The Bowl of Embers (Hard) can be accessed via the Duty Finder.<br>※This objective must be completed as a dragoon.",
        "You have extinguished the Lord of the Inferno and obtained a white-hot ember. Next, take on Garuda in the Howling Eye (Hard) and defeat her to obtain a howling gale.<br><br>※The Howling Eye (Hard) can be accessed via the Duty Finder.<br>※This objective must be completed as a dragoon.",

        "You have buried the Lord of Crags and obtained a chunk of hyperfused ore. Deliver it along with the white-hot ember and the howling gale to Gerolt.",
        "You have delivered the three items Gerolt requires to create a raging fire. Now he only wants for a bottle of Radz–at–Han quenching oil to complete the restoration of your relic. Obtain this item and deliver it to the weaponsmith.",
        "You have delivered the bottle of Radz–at–Han quenching oil to Gerolt, who promptly sees to the final stage of the restoration process. After no small amount of effort and perseverance, you are now the proud owner of the Gae Bolg. May it serve you well in your adventures to come!"

Even as he declares his work over, however, the man believes that there is still something incomplete about it. In order to shed light upon the mystery, Gerolt suggests that you seek out literature surrounding the hero associated with the relic.

Even as he declares his work over, however, the man believes that there is still something incomplete about it. In order to shed light upon the mystery, Gerolt suggests that you seek out literature surrounding the hero associated with the relic. Perhaps the trader Rowena back at Revenant's Toll will be able to assist you in this endeavor.",

In the meantime, you are to familiarize yourself with the restored weapon in its current state. Arm yourself with the unfinished Thyrus, make your way to U'Ghamaro Mines in outer La Noscea, and there slay eight U'Ghamaro quarrymen, eight U'Ghamaro priests, and eight U'Ghamaro bedesmen.",

To this end, he bids you challenge the hydra within Halatali, the abandoned training grounds situated in eastern Thanalan.

Search for a vessel in which the valuable relic might be kept.",

The weaponsmith next directs you to go to the Weeping Saint in the Coerthas central highlands, and obtain alumina salts from the dhorme chimera.<br><br>※The dhorme chimera can be confronted via the Duty Finder upon examining the quest destination.<br>※This objective must be completed as a bard.",

        "Using the alumina salts you brought him, Gerolt adds the finishing touches to your relic weapon. Even as he declares his work over, however, the man believes that there is still something incomplete about it. In order to shed light upon the mystery, Gerolt suggests that you seek out literature surrounding the hero associated with the relic. Perhaps the trader Rowena back at Revenant's Toll will be able to assist you in this endeavor.",
        "You have consulted Rowena, who agrees to procure the literature you seek...for a price. For your part of the deal, you must obtain for her an Amdapor glyph.

        "After a cursory examination of the text, Gerolt declares that he will require some time to make sense of its contents. In the meantime, you are to familiarize yourself with the restored weapon in its current state. Arm yourself with the unfinished Artemis Bow, make your way to Natalan in the Coerthas central highlands, and there slay eight Natalan boldwings, eight Natalan fogcallers, and eight Natalan windtalons.",
        "You have defeated the specified Ixal. Return to Hyrstmill and report your success to Gerolt.",

To this end, he bids you challenge the hydra within Halatali, the abandoned training grounds situated in eastern Thanalan. Armed with the unfinished Artemis Bow, enter Halatali and defeat the hydra.<br><br>※The hydra can be confronted via the Duty Finder upon examining the quest destination.",

        "You have obtained the timeworn Veil of Wiyu. Make your way back to Hyrstmill and present the relic to Gerolt.",
        "According to Gerolt, the restoration process involves merging the old with the new─that is, embedding the original relic in a new host weapon. To this end, you must bring him an erudite's picatrix of casting melded with two grade three savage might materia.",
        "You have delivered the materia-enhanced erudite's picatrix of casting to Gerolt. The weaponsmith next directs you to go to the Weeping Saint in the Coerthas central highlands, and obtain alumina salts from the dhorme chimera.<br><br>※The dhorme chimera can be confronted via the Duty Finder upon examining the quest destination.<br>※This objective must be completed as a summoner.",
        "You have painstakingly obtained the pinch of alumina salts. Make your way back to Hyrstmill and deliver it to Gerolt.",
        "Using the alumina salts you brought him, Gerolt adds the finishing touches to your relic weapon. Even as he declares his work over, however, the man believes that there is still something incomplete about it. In order to shed light upon the mystery, Gerolt suggests that you seek out literature surrounding the hero associated with the relic. Perhaps the trader Rowena back at Revenant's Toll will be able to assist you in this endeavor.",
        "You have consulted Rowena, who agrees to procure the literature you seek...for a price. For your part of the deal, you must obtain for her an Amdapor glyph. Make your way through Amdapor Keep in the South Shroud, and procure this artifact.<br><br>※Amdapor Keep can be accessed via the Duty Finder.<br>※This objective must be completed as a summoner.",
        "You have successfully obtained an Amdapor glyph. Make your way back to Revenant's Toll and deliver it to Rowena.",
        "You give the Amdapor glyph to Rowena, who upholds her promise and furnishes you a copy of <span class=\"emphasis\">Under the Veil</span>. You now possess literature on the hero who once wielded the relic weapon. Gerolt the weaponsmith will be keen to peruse it.",
        "After a cursory examination of the text, Gerolt declares that he will require some time to make sense of its contents. In the meantime, you are to familiarize yourself with the restored weapon in its current state. Arm yourself with the unfinished Veil of Wiyu, make your way to the Sylphlands in the East Shroud, and there slay eight sylpheed snarls, eight sylpheed sighs, and eight sylpheed screeches.",
        "You have defeated the specified sylphs. Return to Hyrstmill and report your success to Gerolt.",
        "Upon your return, Gerolt deduces that you must face mightier adversaries if you are to experience a revelation pertaining to your relic. To this end, he bids you challenge the hydra within Halatali, the abandoned training grounds situated in eastern Thanalan. Armed with the unfinished Veil of Wiyu, enter Halatali and defeat the hydra.<br><br>※The hydra can be confronted via the Duty Finder upon examining the quest destination.",
        "You have overcome the hydra. Take word of your accomplishment back to Gerolt at Hyrstmill.",
        "Combining information gleaned from the text with your firsthand experience, Gerolt has ascertained what must be done next. Hand over the unfinished Veil of Wiyu to the weaponsmith.",
        "Gerolt declares that but one step remains in the restoration. In order to create the raging fire that he needs, the weaponsmith bids you fetch him a white-hot ember, a howling gale, and a chunk of hyperfused ore. The first of these can be obtained by defeating Ifrit within the Bowl of Embers (Hard).<br><br>※The Bowl of Embers can be accessed via the Duty Finder.<br>※This objective must be completed as a summoner.",
        "You have extinguished the Lord of the Inferno and obtained a white-hot ember. Next, take on Garuda in the Howling Eye (Hard) and defeat her to obtain a howling gale.<br><br>※The Howling Eye can be accessed via the Duty Finder.<br>※This objective must be completed as a summoner.",

        "You have buried the Lord of Crags and obtained a chunk of hyperfused ore. Deliver it along with the white-hot ember and the howling gale to Gerolt.",
        "You have delivered the three items Gerolt requires to create a raging fire. Now he only wants for a bottle of Radz–at–Han quenching oil to complete the restoration of your relic. Obtain this item and deliver it to the weaponsmith.",
        "You have delivered the bottle of Radz–at–Han quenching oil to Gerolt, who promptly sees to the final stage of the restoration process. After no small amount of effort and perseverance, you are now the proud owner of the Veil of Wiyu. May it serve you well in your adventures to come!"

        "Gerolt has reluctantly agreed to lend his expertise to the restoration of a legendary arm of yore. For the first step, the weaponsmith bids you venture to the Sapsa Spawning Grounds in western La Noscea to retrieve a copy of the <span class=\"emphasis\">Omnilex</span>. Search for a vessel in which the valuable relic might be kept.",
        "You have obtained a timeworn copy of the <span class=\"emphasis\">Omnilex</span>. Make your way back to Hyrstmill and present the relic to Gerolt.",
        "According to Gerolt, the restoration process involves merging the old with the new─that is, embedding the original relic in a new host weapon. To this end, you must bring him an erudite's picatrix of healing melded with two grade three quicktongue materia.",
        "You have delivered the materia-enhanced erudite's picatrix of healing to Gerolt. The weaponsmith next directs you to go to the Weeping Saint in the Coerthas central highlands, and obtain alumina salts from the dhorme chimera.<br><br>※The dhorme chimera can be confronted via the Duty Finder upon examining the quest destination.<br>※This objective must be completed as a scholar.",
        "You have painstakingly obtained the pinch of alumina salts. Make your way back to Hyrstmill and deliver it to Gerolt.",
        "Using the alumina salts you brought him, Gerolt adds the finishing touches to your relic weapon. Even as he declares his work over, however, the man believes that there is still something incomplete about it. In order to shed light upon the mystery, Gerolt suggests that you seek out literature surrounding the heroes associated with the relic. Perhaps the trader Rowena back at Revenant's Toll will be able to assist you in this endeavor.",
        "You have consulted Rowena, who agrees to procure the literature you seek...for a price. For your part of the deal, you must obtain for her an Amdapor glyph. Make your way through Amdapor Keep in the South Shroud, and procure this artifact.<br><br>※Amdapor Keep can be accessed via the Duty Finder.<br>※This objective must be completed as a scholar.",

        "You give the Amdapor glyph to Rowena, who upholds her promise and furnishes you a copy of <span class=\"emphasis\">War of the Magi</span>. You now possess literature on the heroes who once wielded the relic weapon. Gerolt the weaponsmith will be keen to peruse it.",
        "After a cursory examination of the text, Gerolt declares that he will require some time to make sense of its contents. In the meantime, you are to familiarize yourself with the restored weapon in its current state. Arm yourself with the unfinished copy of the <span class=\"emphasis\">Omnilex</span>, make your way to the Sapsa Spawning Grounds in western La Noscea, and there slay eight Sapsa shelfspine, eight Sapsa shelfclaw, and eight Sapsa shelftooth.",
        "You have defeated the specified Sahagin. Return to Hyrstmill and report your success to Gerolt.",
        "Upon your return, Gerolt deduces that you must face mightier adversaries if you are to experience a revelation pertaining to your relic. To this end, he bids you challenge the hydra within Halatali, the abandoned training grounds situated in eastern Thanalan. Armed with the unfinished copy of the <span class=\"emphasis\">Omnilex</span>, enter Halatali and defeat the hydra.<br><br>※The hydra can be confronted via the Duty Finder upon examining the quest destination.",

        "Gerolt declares that but one step remains in the restoration. In order to create the raging fire that he needs, the weaponsmith bids you fetch him a white-hot ember, a howling gale, and a chunk of hyperfused ore. The first of these can be obtained by defeating Ifrit within the Bowl of Embers (Hard).<br><br>※The Bowl of Embers (Hard) can be accessed via the Duty Finder.<br>※This objective must be completed as a scholar.",

        "The cause of Surito Carito's frustration is a lack of progress─he cannot cure the sickness without learning more of it. He explains the scourge of his people came from the ocean, upon a trader's galley. Sailors lost in a terrible storm drifted to a desert isle in the south seas, where they met a tribe of Lalafells. These natives gave the traders succor, and sent them home with a wondrous gift─an ornate amphora. Upon hearing the tale in full, however, Alka Zolka realizes that this vase may be the sickness's source, for would not these traders otherwise have transformed? To discover the truth of this, and learn more of the illness, Surito Carito entreats you to search for the south seas amphora in what remains of the Floating City of Nym.",

        "You pry the empty amphora from the soil. Return to Surito by the Wanderer's Palace, and ask whether or not this is the south seas amphora you seek.",
        "Though amazed to find it intact, Surito concludes that the vase is the selfsame amphora the traders brought back to Nym. However, he is shocked by what he sees inside: a binding sigil, carved into the bottom to hold a voidsent. Surito reveals that this is the work of Mhach, an ancient nation of magi who drew their might from the void and coveted Nym. Bewildered, he wonders if everything, from the storm to the traders' miraculous return, had been a Mhachi plot to bring low his people. Greatly troubled, he asks for time to think upon the role that void magi played in spreading the sickness.<br><br>※The next scholar quest will be available from Surito Carito upon reaching level 56."

With the operation against the Serpent Reavers coming to a successful close, the troops will report to Maelstrom Command. Bring word of your operation at the Isles of Umbra to Broken Mountain at Camp Bronze Lake.",
        "Broken Mountain is reassured at your safe return, and surprised that such weak foes were able to awaken the inner beast so fiercely that you learned a new technique. He informs you that Curious Gorge is recovering from recent injuries suffered during his latest operation against the kobolds. Visit Curious Gorge and exchange battle stories in the relaxing hot springs.",
        "You learn that Curious Gorge was injured in an operation against the kobolds after throwing himself on top of a bomb with more destructive capability than any that have been seen from the kobolds before. Despite the strength of the bomb, Curious Gorge's wounds are relatively light, and he is on the road to make a full recovery. Broken Mountain makes the connection between his brother's story and yours, and surmises that the key to taming the inner beast might lie in the resolve to protect the lives of one's allies.<br><br>However, while Broken Mountain is eager to test his theory by having his brother challenge a powerful adversary as you did, Curious Gorge remains fearful that the beast within will overcome him. The troubled warrior asks you let him think on this dilemma in peace. It seems Broken Mountain has some words he would like to share with you before you depart. Visit him to get his read on the situation.",
        "Broken Mountain's theory is that the inner beast is roused in the heat of battle, and tamed when a warrior resolves to protect the lives of his allies. If he is correct, then his brother will no longer have to fear losing control, so long as he fights to protect those he holds dear. However, if Curious Gorge does lose control again, someone must have the strength to bring him back from the brink of bloodlust. Continue your training so that Curious Gorge can swing his axe without hesitation during his next battle.<br><br>※The next warrior quest will be available from Broken Mountain upon reaching level 58."

She speculates that the individual may have attempted to make contact with other black mages, namely your three beastman friends. Proceed to Burgundy Falls in eastern Thanalan and ask Kazagg Chah whether he has had any unusual guests of late.",

Introducing himself as Zhai'a Nelhah, a Hearer of Gridania, he informs you that the Seedseer Council has sent him to find a certain black mage. Upon hearing of the Book of Thal, Zhai'a Nelhah believes that he may learn something useful from Lalai, and decides to pay her a visit. Return to Milvaneth Sacrarium in Ul'dah and be present for the meeting.",

Waldeve was once a conjurer of Stillglade Fane, but he forsook the art of healing in order to sate his hunger for power. It seems clear that he is the thief who stole the Book of Thal, and with it seeks to unleash unspeakable destruction. Though their ideologies are completely at odds, in order to avert disaster, Zhai'a Nelhah and Lalai resign themselves to working with one another. After the Hearer takes his leave, Lalai teaches you a new spell─Ley Lines─which she deciphered from the Book of Nald. She bids you apply yourself to mastering the spell, and promises to let you know if there are any developments.<br><br>※The next black mage quest will be available from Lalai upon reaching level 54."

        "Lalai has received an unexpected letter.",
        "Lalai has received a letter from 269th Order Mendicant Da Za. Though somewhat scarce of detail, the letter requests that you meet him at Bronze Lake. The timing of this unsolicited correspondence strongly suggests that Waldeve may be involved. Travel to Bronze Lake and ask Da Za what prompted this sudden communication while Lalai reluctantly informs Zhai'a Nelhah of this development.",
        "You find Da Za at Bronze Lake. He explains that he was indeed approached by Waldeve. The man spoke of the Defiant and asked Da Za to share his knowledge of black magic. The wily kobold asked for time to reconsider, arranging another meeting and an opportunity to ambush the dangerous man with your assistance. Travel to the meeting point at the northeast of Bronze Lake and lie in hiding nearby while Da Za waits for Waldeve.",
        "Before long, the leader of the Defiant, Waldeve, arrives. He seems to have recently come into ownership of an ancient tome left by Ququruka─no doubt the Book of Thal. Unfortunately, Da Za's cunning plan for capturing the renegade black mage failed to account for the possibility of the man simply walking away. Waldeve may be gone, but his cultists remain. They know of the secrets passed down to Da Za from his ancestor, and Ququruka's friend, Da Gu, and they plan to extract these secrets from him...by any means necessary. Intervene before the outnumbered kobold is overpowered.",
        "The battle with the Defiant mages is vicious and short. There are no survivors. Assist Da Za and confirm that he is unharmed.",
        "Da Za thanks you for your help, expressing his awe at the raw destructive power you brought to bear on his assailants. Zhai'a Nelhah, having heard of Da Za's letter from Lalai, arrives in time to witness only the aftermath of your fight. He is utterly incensed that you have left not a single cultist alive. Furious that this promising opportunity to question Waldeve's men has been squandered, he storms away to speak with Lalai. Return to Milvaneth Sacrarium and attempt to spare her from the Miqo'te's fury.",
        "Zhai'a Nelhah confronts Lalai with the chilling parallels between your battle with the Defiant and the War of the Magi so many years ago. Though Lalai sympathizes with his concerns, she points out that it was not just black magic that brought about the Sixth Umbral Calamity─white magic, too, was involved. In any case, she doubts Zhai'a's claims that you were not in full control of your powers, and proves as much by entrusting you with even more powerful magicks that she gleaned from the Book of Nald in your absence.<br><br>※The next black mage quest will be available from Lalai upon reaching level 56."

Frantic for answers, they will soon be forced to reveal themselves. You need simply wait for that moment.<br><br>※The next black mage quest will be available from Lalai upon reaching level 58."

A response has finally come from the Temple Knights of Ishgard. The Defiant have been witnessed at the Holy See. Zhai'a Nelhah knows nothing of this nation and requests your assistance in following up on this sighting. Travel to the Arc of the Worthy in Ishgard and speak with the Temple Knights for more details concerning Waldeve's whereabouts.",

However, the trail has not been lost. Reports now reach the capital that the Defiant have been seen at the Convictory, in the Coerthas western highlands. However, the Convictors do not share the Temple Knights' resolute steadfastness.

Unfortunately, it seems that Zhai'a Nelhah has heard this, too, and has headed off to confront them without you. Find him before he gets himself killed.",

However, he goes on to explain that he feared the Defiant mages would lose control of their powers if forced to defend themselves against a black mage of your skill. With, once again, no Defiant survivors to question, you are left with no leads. Return to Lalai and pass on Zhai'a Nelhah's apologies.",

It seems that the cultists lurk at the Burning Wall in eastern Thanalan. Hurry there with Lalai and meet with Zhai'a Nelhah before he attempts to confront them himself.",
        "You rendezvous with Lalai, but see no sign of Zhai'a Nelhah. Lalai fears that he attacked the Defiant alone. It makes no difference. You have no choice but to descend the Burning Wall and search for Waldeve.",
        "In the deepest depths of the Burning Wall, you encounter Waldeve. In defiance and desperation, he calls forth a great horror from the beyond. Knowing that his powers alone are insufficient─and despite Lalai's warnings of the inherent danger─he plans to control this monstrous voidsent such that all will fall in worship of him. Before he can enact his ghastly plot, Zhai'a Nelhah appears...and with reinforcements! Kazagg Chah, Dozol Meloc, and 269th Order Mendicant Da Za arrive to lend their strength, wisdom, and support. Waldeve's plan fails when, as predicted by Lalai, the voidsent turns on him, defeating him in an instant. This unspeakable, dangerous beast cannot be allowed to escape the Burning Wall. Slay it.<br><br>With the threat of the voidsent resolved, Zhai'a Nelhah steps forward to heal the grievous and brutal wounds that it inflicted upon Waldeve. The criminal is taken away into custody by Zhai'a Nelhah, who asks you to wait for him at Milvaneth Sacrarium, where he intends to thank you formally for your assistance in his investigation. Confer with Lalai.",
        "Lalai decides to return to Ul'dah immediately. She suggests you do the same, but not before you speak with Kazagg Chah, Dozol Meloc, and 269th Order Mendicant Da Za, who assisted you in the battle. This is a valuable opportunity to renew your friendship with these powerful allies.",
        "You thank the beastmen for their support. The bond you share with these noble magi will not be easily broken. Lalai still waits for you at Milvaneth Sacrarium. Return there and speak with her.",
        "With Waldeve under arrest and awaiting sentencing by the Padjals, Zhai'a Nelhah returns to Milvaneth Sacrarium to give you his thanks for your assistance and the Book of Thal, which he recovered from Waldeve. Your actions in the recent battles with the Defiant have shown Zhai'a Nelhah the value of black magic when wielded with wisdom and prudence, and in aid of a noble goal. He hopes that, by entrusting the tome to Lalai's care, he can one day see an age of cooperation between healing and destructive magic.<br><br>※The next black mage quest will be available from Lalai once you have completed the main scenario quest “The Far Edge of Fate.”"

Somewhere within this log, he says, there should be information on the Yatsurugi clan's stolen treasures. After this explanation, the retainer then turns to ask Yuki to use you shinobi, only to find that she has already left to infiltrate the base. Oboro quickly outlines a plan to aid her entry: use smoke bombs to distract the guards. Make your way to the designated areas, and defeat any guards attracted by your diversion.",

        "Having found where her clan's jade jewel was being kept, Princess Yuki has slipped in amongst a host of enemies to retrieve it. While the daring plan seems to have paid off, she now lacks for an exit strategy. Akagi begs you to distract the guards, and Oboro fleshes out the plan by proposing that you use the noise of Raiton to draw the foes away. Strike the path leading away from Oschon's Embrace multiple times, and so secure Yuki's escape.",
        "The foes have heard your thunder, and you hear them as they make their way toward you. Move further away from Oschon's Embrace and strike with Raiton again.",
        "Once again, the guards hear as your thunder echoes through the hills. Make for the Salt Strand, and unleash Raiton again on the way there.",
        "You have drawn your pursuers far from their camp, and away from Princess Yuki. Now, make your way to the Salt Strand proper, and await Oboro.",
        "You arrive on the Salt Strand and are greeted by a man with seemingly sinister intent. From his babbling, you ascertain that he had anticipated Princess Yuki. Yet his familiarity with shinobi─Gekkai and Karasu in particular─leaves you uneasy. The man attacks, revealing that he, too, has a command of ninjutsu. You slay his underlings, and eventually force him to flee after Oboro comes to your aid. Speak now with your shinobi friend and see what he knows of your mysterious combatant.",
        "After a moment's thought, Oboro theorizes that the man was once an imperial spy, trained in ninjutsu by Gekkai and Karasu. What he desired with the princess, however, remains a mystery. In any case, now is not the time to wonder why, but rather to see if Princess Yuki is safe. Travel to the Tempest Gate in lower La Noscea and speak with her.",
        "Princess Yuki has escaped the clutches of her pursuers, her clan's stolen jade jewel now safely in hand. She is aware that you aided her, but seems completely ungrateful. After she takes her leave, however, Akagi says she is secretly thankful. Oboro bids you return with him to the dock storehouse.",
        "As you might have suspected given your recent missions, Oboro once again tells you to meditate upon your experiences, that you might draw new power from within. He also leaves you with a somber warning, and bids you practice vigilance whilst a mysterious foe may lie waiting in the shadows.<br><br>※The next ninja quest will be available from Oboro upon reaching level 56."

        "Jacke has discovered that the Yatsurugi clan's dagger is to go up for auction. The sellers are a group known as the Truehounds─a band of Salthounds who never left the brine. Ostensibly, they liberated the Far Eastern treasures from an imperial vessel's hold, and, with Princess Yuki's word being the only proof otherwise, Jacke regretfully informs you the guild cannot get involved. However, he directs you to a black marketeer newly come to the guild's attention. To learn more of the Truehounds, seek out this shadowy character at the House of Sticks in lower La Noscea.",
        "You defeat the trio of Qiqirn that appears. Now, present the sack of gil to the black marketeer.",
        "Though a cowl covers his face, the black marketeer's voice sounds oddly familiar. However, he does away with any introductions, and jumps immediately to the heart of the matter─the Truehounds. Captained by one Rosalinde, these cutthroats have made their name and fortune on the Far Eastern seas. What they lack in numbers, they make up for by imbibing pluto before boarding their victims' vessels. Moreover, they have recently hired a mercenary known as Redway─a man trained in ninjutsu by Gekkai. The entire crew has dropped anchor in Costa del Sol. Travel there now, and spy on the fiends.",
        "You crouch in the shadows as Captain Rosalinde and Redway converse. The so-called shinobi has gathered information on you and your allies just as you have on him and his. You also overhear the leader of the Truehounds as she lays out her plan to capture Princess Yuki by using the clan treasure as bait, and the auction as the trap. Return now to Oboro in the dock storehouse, and inform him of these dire developments.",
        "Princess Yuki and Akagi have been waiting for you at the storehouse. Upon learning of the Truehounds' involvement, Yuki reveals that it was not only the treasures they stole from her clan, but the lives of her people as well. Though the princess had wished to fight back, her vassals forbade it, and laid down their lives in her defense. When she left her lands, she vowed that never again would she allow someone to die for her. Akagi seizes this opportunity to force her hand, and, finally, Yuki accepts your and Oboro's aid. However, she has a condition─you may not sacrifice your own life for hers. Having reached an agreement, Oboro asks that everyone wait for further news of the black market auction.<br><br>※The next ninja quest will be available from Oboro upon reaching level 58."

        "The Truehounds' auction has come and gone, and the Yatsurugi clan's blade has been sold to an Ishgardian collector who paid extra to have the dagger taken directly to his home. Princess Yuki plans to attack the transit directly in order to reclaim the dagger. To make matters easier, Oboro then suggests that you swap the pirates' pluto for lavender incense, that you might use their dependence against them and send them to sleep. He proposes that the four of you split up. He and Akagi will find where the Truehounds are keeping their stores in Limsa Lominsa, while you and the princess will purchase the incense from Kyokyoroon in Hawkers' Alley. Yuki, as usual, takes off in a huff, leaving you to follow behind her with the sack of gil to pay the merchant.",
        "Shortly after purchasing a sack of lavender incense from Kyokyoroon, Yuki receives an unpleasant surprise─a pair of her vassals from the Far East has come in search of her. The princess deftly avoids their gaze, and vanishes with Akagi. A bemused Oboro instructs you to leave the princess to him, and asks that you make your way to Fisherman's Bottom. Once there, switch the pluto for the lavender incense.",
        "The Truehounds will now fall into a deep slumber instead of receiving their usual stimulation. Now, wait near the docks and watch to make certain the guards do not detect your ruse.",
        "You wait and listen as two Truehounds discuss their planned route─sail to Dravania, and go on foot from there to Ishgard. As the journey is long, and their crates heavy, they plan to stop once in the Smoldering Wastes and there take their “pluto.” With all parties in agreement that this would be the ideal place to strike, make your way to the Dravanian forelands and rendezvous with Princess Yuki and Oboro.",
        "You arrive to find that Oboro's plan worked perfectly, with several Truehounds already snoring nearby and Yuki searching through their crates. However, as she has not yet found the Midare Kanemitsu dagger, and there are yet more Truehounds in the area, she bids you join Akagi and Oboro in their own patrols. Proceed to keep a lookout to the southwest, and dispatch any enemies that may come your way.",
        "You have made short work of the Truehound patrol. Return to where Yuki was looking and see if Oboro and Akagi have anything to report from their own search.",
        "You find Oboro none the worse for wear after his patrol. However, Akagi was not exaggerating his lack of martial prowess, and has sustained a serious injury. The princess joins you, triumphantly announcing that the last of her clan's treasures is again hers. However, both you and Oboro feel the hair on the back of your necks stand up. You turn to see Redway standing but a few yalms away. Instead of attacking, however, the man offers an ultimatum: the princess comes with him, or her vassals who recently came to Eorzea die. Unable to refuse, the princess walks away, leaving you with a single command: tend to Akagi. Beaten, Oboro orders you all to return to the dock storehouse.",
        "Though you have lost this battle, Oboro is intent that you not lose the war; Princess Yuki did not forbid you from mounting a rescue. Await the day when Akagi is healed, as is your duty as a shinobi, and then save the princess from Redway and Rosalinde's clutches.<br><br>※The next ninja quest will be available from Oboro upon reaching level 60."

        "The unwanted visitors are no more. Tell Oboro as much.",
        "Though Oboro had come up with a plan to sneak across to Hullbreaker Isle, the recent attack on the storehouse has changed his mind. If Redway has seen fit to send assassins to your hideout, no doubt unfriendly eyes watch the docks, as well. Oboro reasons the wisest course of action now is to see what opposition awaits you, and asks that you join him at the Moraby Drydocks.",
        "Crouched on a battlement, you and Oboro look out over the harbor in dismay. There are too many guards to fight. However, your friend is not without a plan. He supposes that since it is <span class=\"emphasis\">you</span> who is bound by duty to save Princess Yuki, he is therefore free to put himself at risk and draw Redway's attention. This will allow you to sneak across the channel in the boat Jacke has provided. Retreat to Oschon's Torch and wait for your moment.",
        "Redway has gleefully captured Oboro, and left with his men. After pacifying an agitated Akagi, the two of you resolve to infiltrate the Truehounds' camp on Hullbreaker Isle. Speak with him at the Moraby Drydocks.",

        "Rosalinde promised the captive vassals' freedom in exchange for the treasures of the Yatsurugi clan. However, the captain goes back on her word when Princess Yuki brings them, and orders her bound and stowed with the other prisoners. Just as all hope seems lost, you appear with Akagi. Princess Yuki finally commands you to rescue her. You draw your daggers, slash Oboro's bonds, and take the fight to Redway. When the sellsword realizes he is losing, he makes to run─only to meet a gory end on Rosalinde's axe blade. After the battle continues, you finally put an end to the cutthroat captain's reaving for good. Their leader dead, the remaining Truehounds run, leaving behind all the treasures of the Yatsurugi clan. Princess Yuki offers her heartfelt thanks, and then turns excitedly to her freed vassals. With the profits from these treasures, her lands can be rebuilt. Oboro indicates it is time to take your leave. Speak with him in the dock storehouse.",
        "Oboro congratulates you for the successful completion of your first mission. Truly, few other shinobi could have earned their master's trust as you earned Princess Yuki's. Now, he bids you meditate upon your experiences, and continue upon the path towards mastery of the art of ninjutsu.<br><br>※The next ninja quest will be available from Oboro once you have completed the main scenario quest “The Far Edge of Fate.”"

Alas, with the majority of her fellow dragoons absent, she can muster only a token force of defenders, and so Ser Alberic bids you lend your lance to the mission. Make haste to the Congregation of Our Knights Most Heavenly and join Heustienne ahead of her departure.",
        "Your offer of aid is received by Heustienne with thanks, and by her father with relief. After his daughter leaves, Montorgains asks that you watch over her, lest her desire to distinguish herself in battle cloud her judgment. Having given him your assurance, make now for the western highlands of Coerthas and rejoin your fellow dragoons.",
        "You arrive to find the battle already raging, with the dragoons incurring heavy losses. Together with Heustienne, you succeed in repelling the remaining enemy forces, but their leader, Graoully, is conspicuous in his absence. Just when it seems the dragon will not appear, his menacing shadow falls over you. Heustienne impulsively leaps at Graoully, piercing his hide with her lance, and you and Brucemont can only look on helplessly as she is borne away. Speak with Brucemont and see if aught can be done.",
        "Brucemont does not mince words: he is not hopeful of Heustienne's survival. He entrusts to you a fragment of her armor, broken off in battle, and bids you see it to her father's hands at the Congregation of Our Knights Most Heavenly.",
        "You deliver the fragment of armor to Montorgains in lieu of the tragic news, but he refuses to believe that Heustienne is gone. Upon hearing your account of events, he dares to hope that his daughter is still alive. Ser Alberic swears to do all in his power to find her, and bids you meet him at the Observatorium to deliberate a course of action.",
        "Alberic fears that Heustienne may have been taken deep into Dravanian territory, but he is determined to rescue her. While he tracks Graoully's movements to ascertain Heustienne's location, dedicate yourself to honing your lance arm, that you may be ready for the trials to come.<br><br>※The next dragoon quest will be available from Alberic upon reaching level 56."

According to Ser Alberic's source, the Bloodbearers have most recently been sighted in the Chocobo Forest. If his instincts serve, and Heustienne means to reclaim her lance Peregrine, she will surely go after them, presenting a chance for you to be reunited with her. Make your way to the Dravanian forelands and join Ser Alberic at Tailfeather.",

Ser Alberic is convinced that they are the Bloodbearers, here to replenish their stores. He bids you help him search the area for these so-called merchants. If you notice any suspicious individuals, confront them and gauge their reaction.",

It appears there is to be a meeting of some description in an area of the forest south of Tailfeather. Make your way there and be present for whatever may come to pass.",
        "You arrive at the scene of the meeting to find Heustienne on her knees but alive, the dead bodies of several heretics strewn about her. As Ser Alberic predicted, she has come to recover her lance. Yet, though she has accomplished this task, she refuses to return with you to Ishgard. At Ser Alberic's insistence, she finally reveals the reason for her actions: when she was a prisoner of the heretics, she was made to drink dragon blood, and had already once turned into a dragon. Resigned to being judged a heretic by the inquisition, she declares her intent to go after Graoully, and Ser Alberic can find no words to change her mind. For now, rejoin Ser Alberic at the Observatorium.",
        "Ser Alberic believes that Heustienne has a fighting chance against Graoully, if she can but master the dragon power that threatens to consume her. He bids you resume your training, all the while keeping your purpose close to your heart, that you may be ready to stand with Heustienne in her ultimate test.<br><br>※The next dragoon quest will be available from Alberic upon reaching level 60."

        "Jehantel would help you rise to greater heights in your art.",
        "Jehantel tells you of his recent endeavors, namely training the members of the Gods' Quiver. By taking an interest in the development of the younger generation, he feels that his songs have gained in power, and believes that yours could, too. If you have a mind to rise to new heights as a bard, accept Jehantel's invitation and go to Quiver's Hold, where you will be introduced to his acquaintance.",
        "Arriving at Quiver's Hold, you are introduced to a man named Sanson, a captain of the Order of the Twin Adder. Though he is a lancer by training, Sanson believes in the power of song, and is seeking to establish a new unit which incorporates bards. To his frustration, however, thus far the leaders of the Gods' Quiver have not been amenable to his requests for cooperation. Presently, he will meet with them again, and hopes to sway them with the existence of a legendary song said to hold the power to bring battles to a decisive end: the Ballad of Oblivion. Make your way to the Seat of the First Bow and be present for the meeting.",
        "The meeting does not proceed as well as Sanson had hoped. The Gods' Quiver are still unwilling to lend their cooperation, though Lewin allows that he is intrigued by the Ballad of Oblivion. Sanson declares his intent to go on a journey to find this song, but even this endeavor is met with opposition. The leader of the Gold Bull unit─a man who does not think highly of bards─assigns Sanson a trial to test his fitness to embark on his proposed expedition: culling enraged treants in the East Shroud. In this manner, the meeting comes to an end. Speak with Jehantel to hear his thoughts on the trial.",
        "Dubious as to whether the Gods' Quiver actually mean to dispatch a bard, Jehantel bids you aid Sanson in the trial. Make your way to the East Shroud and join the serpent captain at Amarissaix's Spire.",
        "You arrive to find Sanson on his knees and surrounded by enraged treants. Vanquish the creatures and assist your companion.",
        "You defeat the treants and help Sanson to his feet. At that moment, you are almost taken unaware by yet another creature, but before it can do you harm, a mysterious archer appears and puts it down with a barrage of arrows. Introducing himself as Guydelot, the cocksure fellow is revealed to be the bard assigned to your expedition and one of Jehantel's students. Yet in spite of Guydelot's ability, Sanson is unconvinced of his suitability, and makes his displeasure towards the man abundantly clear. Speak with Jehantel to learn what he thinks of this rocky introduction.",
        "Jehantel does not mince words: watching over the conflict between Sanson and Guydelot will be a burden upon you. By the same token, however, he believes that the experience will help you to grow as a bard. Make your way back to Quiver's Hold and join Sanson as he reports the success of his trial.",
        "With the trial's success, Sanson receives official permission to proceed with the expedition. So it is that your journey to find the Ballad of Oblivion begins. For the first leg, make your way to Ishgard, and rejoin your companions at the aetheryte plaza.",
        "Upon arriving in Ishgard, Sanson declares that he will begin by making inquiries. He bids you rest and recover your strength, for it will most certainly be called upon as the journey unfolds.<br><br>※The next bard quest will be available from Sanson upon reaching level 52."

Deeply grateful, the knight, Ser Alamenain, offers to assist in your search for the Ballad of Oblivion. He tells you of a woman who is said to send souls unto the heavens with a song, and believes that this song may be what you seek. With matters now settled after a fashion, make your way back to Falcon's Nest and rejoin Sanson.",

Specifically, the woman who is said to sing the song is a soldier stationed at the Convictory. Sanson declares that the three of you will go there to seek her out. Make your way to the Ishgardian encampment and join your companions.",
        "You have tracked down the soldier, Celaine. However, though she admits to singing the song, she stubbornly refuses to teach it to you. Presently, Guydelot is attempting to coax it out of her; ask him how his efforts fare.",
        "No amount of words will sway Celaine to teach you the song, and Guydelot is loath to press her further. But Sanson, determined to accomplish his duty, proposes a deal: the three of you will assist the Ishgardians in a dragon-culling operation in exchange for being near in case Celaine employs the song in battle. Make your way to Twinpools and present yourself to the Convictor knight to receive instructions.",

        "You have dispatched a sufficient number of dragons. Rejoin Sanson and the others.",
        "Though the culling operation is a success, the Convictors have incurred heavy losses. Stricken with sadness, Celaine begins singing a requiem for her fallen comrades, which Guydelot recognizes as the song to send souls unto the heavens. Follow Sanson's lead and pay your respects with a /salute.",
        "Appreciative of your gesture, Celaine opens up to you. At Guydelot's encouragement, she resolves to savor the time she has with her comrades, rather than keep them at arm's length to spare herself the pain of loss. In her turn, she counsels Guydelot and Sanson to appreciate each other's company. Finally, she speaks of the requiem, which she says was taught to her by a scholar of Ishgardian history named Sylviel, who is based in the settlement of Tailfeather. Speak with Sanson to learn what your next step will be.",
        "It is decided that you will go to Tailfeather to seek out Sylviel. Make your way to the settlement in the Dravanian forelands and rejoin your companions.",
        "Sylviel has apparently left Tailfeather on one of his many surveys, and you must await his return. With the mission taking you into ever more perilous territory, see to it that you are fully prepared for whatever lies ahead.<br><br>※The next bard quest will be available upon reaching level 56."

As a gesture of gratitude, the scholar promises to investigate the legend further. And though Sanson is hopeful that this will lead you to the Ballad of Oblivion, Guydelot is not wholly convinced. The two exchange heated words, and Guydelot subsequently storms out of the settlement.

Alas, the information he provided is not as promising as Sanson had hoped, with “the heavens” most likely referring to a natural phenomenon, as Guydelot had suspected. Just when Sanson resigns himself to accepting that the legend is a dead end, you reveal to him the existence of a tribe of moogles in the Churning Mists. The revelation spurs him to continue his mission, and he begs you to show him to Moghome. Before striking out, he bids you leave a message with Sylviel for Guydelot, in the hopes that the wayward bard will rejoin you later.",
        "To your surprise, you find Sylviel conversing with Guydelot, who apparently has been watching you and Sanson from afar. Upon hearing of the moogles of Moghome, Sylviel concedes that the legend may in fact be referring to the creatures, and urges Guydelot to settle his differences with Sanson and accompany him to the Churning Mists. For now, however, a promise to think on it is the best the bard can offer. Your message thus delivered, make your way to Anyx Trine and rejoin Sanson.",
        "Sanson is eager to continue on to the Churning Mists. Lead the way to the summit of Sohm Al, and speak with your companion when you arrive.",
        "Shortly after arriving at Moghome, Sanson declares his intent to seek an audience with the moogle chieftain. As he walks away, you catch a glimpse of what appears to be Guydelot, hiding behind a rock. Set aside that sighting in your mind for the time being, and join Sanson for his meeting with Moglin.",
        "Moglin informs you that the Ballad of Oblivion is exceedingly dangerous, and hence is forbidden among mooglekind. In spite of his ominous words, however, he goes to great lengths to point you in the direction of a moogle bard named Mogta, who has also shown an interest in the song. Sanson bids you meet him outside Moghome to discuss the chieftain's curious behavior.",
        "Whatever Moglin's intention may be, Sanson believes that there is no harm in seeking out Mogta. Search for the moogle bard at the specified location in Eil Tohm.",
        "Mogta does not appear to be in the area. Take your search to another part of Eil Tohm.",

        "Mogta does not appear to be in the area. Take your search towards the Landlord Colony.",
        "Just as you are about to give up searching for Mogta, the moogle stumbles into you. You quickly establish your shared interest in the Ballad of Oblivion, and he becomes a member of your expedition. Return to Moghome and receive Moglin's blessing to search for the forbidden song.",
        "Moglin declares that your company is still missing a little something, and so withholds his permission for you to seek the Ballad of Oblivion. Sanson discerns that something to be Guydelot, at which time you finally reveal to him your earlier sighting of the bard near Moghome. Mogta is convinced that he likes Guydelot, and reassures Sanson that you will yet find him and together continue your mission.<br><br>※The next bard quest will be available from Sanson upon reaching level 60."

Mogta informs you that the Ballad of Oblivion is said to originate from the skies to the east, and you take this to mean the Sea of Clouds. Sanson declares that he will secure an airship to carry you there, and bids you meet him at the airship landing in Gridania. After the serpent captain takes his leave, Mogta reveals to you a secret: he has met with Guydelot, but could not convince the bard to return with him. The moogle believes that you may fare better than he did, and entrusts you with Sanson's journal in case it may be of use. Make your way to the peak of Sohm Al, where Guydelot is lingering, and show the journal to the bard.",
        "In spite of the journal and your earnest pleading, Guydelot refuses to rejoin the fellowship, so ashamed is he of having accused Sanson of using song as a tool. You can only stand and watch as Guydelot leaves to do his soul-searching. Follow your two other companions back to Gridania, and join them at the airship landing.",

        "You find Sanson staring longingly at a stone bearing strange markings. Mogta remembers that it is a stone of sealing, used to imprison baleful beings, but his warning comes a breath too late, and Sanson unleashes the siren that had been held within. The Ballad of Oblivion is revealed to be the fiend's soul-rending voice, which she used to annihilate the tribe of moogles that once dwelled upon Mok Oogl. Sanson is resolved to face the siren alone, and bids you and Mogta flee. At that moment, Guydelot makes his return, his words instilling Sanson with newfound courage. Together with your companions, you succeed in returning the siren to her stony prison. Though the Ballad of Oblivion never truly existed, Sanson believes that such abilities as you have mastered in the course of the mission will suffice to satisfy his superiors. Follow your friends back to the airship and let Sanson know when you are ready to return to Gridania.",
        "Sanson expresses his heartfelt thanks for your invaluable contributions to the mission. While he makes his report to the Order of the Twin Adder and the Gods' Quiver, he bids you pay a visit to Jehantel west of Quarrymill, that you might regale the old bard with an account of your journey.",

He bids you continue being a paragon of your art, enriching the hearts of men with song.<br><br>※The next bard quest will be available from Jehantel once you have completed the main scenario quest “The Far Edge of Fate.”"

        "The two Padjals are dismayed to learn that they must leave the Twelveswood if they are to defeat the taint. With their duties binding them to the forest, it falls to you to undertake the journey of purification, as the great A–Towa–Cant once did. Wishing to emulate her grandfather's deeds, Eschiva begs to join you on your journey. Speak with her again to reaffirm her intent.",

Having given vent to her irritation, she promises to scour her grandfather's records for clues, and bids you see to your own preparations ahead of the grueling journey.<br><br>※The next white mage quest will be available from Eschiva upon reaching level 52."

With their heightened sensitivity to aether, they believe they can ascertain the site of Alaqa's experiment. Make your way to the Dravanian forelands, where you last saw Alaqa, and join Eschiva and the Seedseers at Tailfeather.",

        "Deep within the cavern of Mourn, you find Alaqa just as she completes her experiment─an undead dragon whose existence is sustained by the taint. Upon confronting her, the Au Ra justifies her actions as self-preservation: her tribesmen have suffered much at the hands of the ignorant, and she desires but to protect them. Having said her piece, she unleashes her pet upon you, but you succeed in overcoming it and purifying the taint which gave it life. With her dreams of vengeance thus shattered, all of the fight goes out of Alaqa.",
        "Though Alaqa must answer for her crimes, Raya–O offers her words of hope for the future. Watching on from a distance, A–Ruhn resolves to do as A–Towa–Cant once did and go wheresoever his powers are needed, be it to the ends of the world. With gratitude, he accepts Eschiva's offer to accompany him as he embarks upon his journeys.",
        "The two Seedseers shall see the misguided Au Ra given over to the Wood Wailers. Afterwards, Raya–O bids you and Eschiva come to see her and A–Ruhn at Camp Tranquil, that they might properly thank you for your services to the Twelveswood.",
        "You bid Eschiva farewell as she departs with A–Ruhn. Together with her siblings, Raya–O vows to continue preserving the harmony of the forest, protecting it from threats both within and without. With your newfound powers, go forth and shine the light of succor and solace across all the realm.<br><br>※The next white mage quest will be available from Raya–O–Senna once you completed the main scenario quest “The Far Edge of Fate.”"

        "Widargelt introduces you to two of his most promising pupils, D'zentsa and O'tchakha, orphans who one day appeared before him. As their senior and his foremost pupil, Widargelt now asks you to assist in their training. Join Widargelt to the southeast of Revenant's Toll.",
        "First, Widargelt asks you to demonstrate your prowess to D'zentsa. Seek her out to the northeast, and defeat any enemies that appear.",
        "You fell your fearsome foe with ease. Turn your attention back to D'zentsa.",
        "You have won D'zentsa's respect and admiration. O'tchakha is next in line to be treated to a display of your sublime skills. Seek her out to the south, and defeat any enemies that appear.",
        "You fell more fearsome foes with ease. Turn your attention back to O'tchakha.",
        "You have won O'tchakha's respect and admiration as well. But as the two friends speak excitedly of training under you, a yell rings out. It appears Widargelt is in danger. Make haste to the place you left him.",
        "You arrive to find Widargelt alone and on his knees, his assailants having since fled. He explains that he was attacked by strange men who fought in the style of monks. During the encounter, a new chakra appears to have opened within Widargelt, though the sensation was unlike anything he has experienced before. For now, return to the safety of Revenant's Toll and rejoin your fellow monks.",
        "Widargelt recounts his encounter with the strange men in detail. As he defended himself, his body was racked by a sudden pain as though something had pierced it. While he is certain that a chakra has opened within him, he does not believe it to be the seventh. For lack of an explanation, he declares that he will seek Professor Erik's advice. Should this phenomenon prove to be a new source of power, Widargelt promises to share its secrets with you.<br><br>※The next monk quest will be available from Widargelt upon reaching level 52."

In the midst of the encounter, you and Widargelt experience the sensation of a new chakra opening. Upon seeing this, D'zentsa and O'tchakha take their leave, but not before revealing the existence of two sects─one of light and one of shadow, the latter to which they belong. Return to Revenant's Toll and speak with Widargelt about these revelations.",

Though their agenda is a mystery, Widargelt has questions of his own that he would ask them. Make your way to northern Thanalan and participate in the meeting.",
        "At the meeting, D'zentsa and O'tchakha explain that there exist two aspects of chakra, one each for the sect of light and the sect of shadow; in order to open a chakra of an aspect not his own, a monk must fight a disciple of the opposing sect. To that end, the two Miqo'te attack you and Widargelt, the battle ending with all four combatants experiencing their chakra opening. Having thus accomplished their task, D'zentsa and O'tchakha take their leave, but not before begging you to give up being a monk. Speak with Widargelt to learn his mind on these revelations.",
        "Unsurprisingly, Widargelt has no intention of relinquishing his dreams of rebuilding the Fist of Rhalgr. However, if you are to deal with the threat posed by the sect of shadow, you must learn more about the two aspects of chakra. Professor Erik will soon be arriving at Revenant's Toll to share with you his insights on the subject. Make your way back to the settlement and be present for what will surely prove to be a most enlightening experience.",
        "Professor Erik supplements your knowledge of the history of the Fist of Rhalgr. The order was once formed of two distinct yet united sects─one of light and one of shadow. Alas, the members of the latter were expelled in the wake of a bitter feud over the order's alliance with the royal house of Ala Mhigo. The professor then appends that members of the two sects once faced one another in single combat to open all fourteen chakra. Widargelt cannot understand why the sect of shadow insists on fighting rather than cooperating. In order to find the answer, he declares his intent to confront D'zentsa and O'tchakha once more. In the meantime, focus on mastering the new power that has been unleashed inside you.<br><br>※The next monk quest will be available from Widargelt upon reaching level 56."

For now, return to Revenant's Toll and discuss a course of action with Widargelt.",

To that end, Widargelt and O'tchakha will seek out fell fiends to do battle against in the nearby area. Seek out fell fiends of your own by lying in wait at the specified location.",

The man explains that he is here to silence O'tchakha, but offers to set her and D'zentsa free in exchange for Widargelt's life and your servitude. The villain leaves, and you are left to ponder his words. Turn your attention now to O'tchakha and provide her with assistance.",

She declares that she will not submit to her former master's demands, and neither must you. For the time being, Widargelt suggests that you return to Revenant's Toll to prepare for the battle to come.",
        "Professor Erik has loaned you his tomes, which O'tchakha is poring over for information on opening your final chakra. Meanwhile, Widargelt bids you focus on honing your mind and body both, that you might be ready to confront H'raha Tia─with or without all fourteen chakra.<br><br>※The next monk quest will be available from Widargelt upon reaching level 60."

        "Time is running out to rescue D'zentsa, and Widargelt is uncharacteristically unsettled.",
        "Though you have not found a way to open your final chakra, you must confront H'raha Tia now, or D'zentsa's life will be forfeit. Widargelt bids you join him and O'tchakha near Little Ala Mhigo in southern Thanalan ahead of the rescue mission.",
        "Desperate to save her friend, O'tchakha bids you fight her, that you might open your final chakra. However, Widargelt will not hear of it. He harbors the hope that, in joining hands, you may yet defeat H'raha Tia. Prepare yourself for the confrontation, and tell Widargelt when you are ready to proceed to the southern ruins, where D'zentsa has been taken.",
        "At the ruins, Widargelt attempts to convince H'raha Tia that fighting one another is not the way. Alas, the master of the sect of shadow will not be swayed from his beliefs, and he sets upon you with fists and feet flying. In the midst of battle, your final chakra opens, allowing you to do battle with H'raha Tia on even footing. And with D'zentsa's belated help, you succeed in overcoming him and his pupils. As the dust settles, speak with Widargelt south of Little Ala Mhigo to know his mind on the battle's outcome.",
        "The pursuit of power was once thought to be the sole route to greatness among the disciples of the Fist of Rhalgr. But by your shining example, this old preconception has been shattered, giving way to alternate paths. Together with D'zentsa and O'tchakha, Widargelt will strive to rebuild the order as it once was, reuniting the sects of light and shadow. As the paragon for a new generation of monks, see to it that you ever exercise your powers for the good of the realm.<br><br>※The next monk quest will be available from Erik once you have completed the main scenario quest “The Far Edge of Fate.”"

However, Papashan has not heard from him since, and is growing increasingly concerned. The stationmaster does not wish to involve Jenlyns until he has learned more of the situation, and so he begs your assistance, which you readily offer.

For a time, Solkzagyl refused, but eventually he relented and accepted the boy as his student. However, he never shared his latest discoveries with Constaint, choosing instead to challenge Death's Embrace when the boy was absent. Though he lacks a master, Constaint is still resolved to become a paladin and reclaim Oathkeeper in Solkzagyl's stead.

        "The missive is rather unusual, in that it appears to have been written weeks ago and sent with a shipment of supplies instead of by more efficient methods. Perhaps most puzzling of all are its words: “I left you a gift near the Hundred Throes. Take it, and become the man you were destined to be.” Though he knows not what to make of it, Constaint heads north to search for whatever it is the deceased paladin hid there for him.",
        "Constaint tells you that you are in the right area, though he cannot say for certain. Search the vicinity for anything unusual.",
        "Beneath a tree, you find a pair of gallant cuisses, as well as a faded soul crystal. Pondering the items, Constaint begins to question if he is being manipulated somehow, though he does not expound upon his suspicions in detail. He departs for Camp Riversmeet, out of a desire to speak with the one man who could explain─if only he were still alive...",
        "As Constaint contemplates what Solkzagyl intended for him, Jenlyns suddenly arrives, having learned of his predecessor's death from Papashan. As he grieves for Solkzagyl, his soul crystal inexplicably begins to glow, as does yours, and a mysterious burst of aether flows from his crystal into yours. However, before you all can discuss what you have witnessed, you become aware of a cloaked man staring at Constaint and the soul crystal in his outstretched hand. The man disappears before you can discover his identity, but Jenlyns concludes that it was another minion of Death's Embrace, spying on Solkzagyl's pupil to see if he will continue to seek Oathkeeper. Jenlyns is, of course, still determined to reclaim the sword, but as you observe Constaint, staring at the cliff where the man once stood, you cannot help but wonder if he is equally resolved.<br><br>※The next paladin quest will be available from Constaint upon reaching level 58."

Before he embarks upon this venture, however, there is one matter he would like to discuss with Hundred Eyes, the man who buried his master...",
        "Constaint begins to question Hundred Eyes about his master's death, but the craftsman brusquely refuses to answer, stating simply that he buried him, and that he needs not know anything else. The boy apologizes for asking and leaves to seek out someone who might know the whereabouts of Death's Embrace.",
        "According to Emerissel, the assassins-turned-bandits have not been seen in western Coerthas for quite some time. Upon learning that the men you seek are Ul'dahn, the Ishgardian is inspired to regale you with a tale of southron idiocy, namely a gang of Ul'dahns who managed to sneak aboard the airships which travel regularly to Camp Cloudtop. The Ul'dahns then attempted to seize the <span class=\"emphasis\">Protector</span>, despite the fact that the airship is not fit for travel. Suspecting this to be a serendipitous coincidence─and having no other leads whatsoever─Constaint suggests that you go and investigate the incident at Camp Cloudtop.",

        "Having learned of House Haillenarte's plans, the Ul'dahns have fled to the east. The commanding officer bids everyone advance with caution, as these are dangerous men desperate to survive.",
        "Though the knights manage some success against the former assassins, you must nevertheless come to their aid. One search party is no longer in danger, but the other is nowhere to be seen...",
        "Constaint and his search party are able to defeat most of the remaining enemies, but they are unable to subdue the bandits' leader. You, however, have no such trouble. Afterwards, you are surprised to discover a pair of gallant gauntlets amongst the man's possessions...",
        "The House Haillenarte knight thanks you for your contribution and leaves to inform Lady Laniaitte of your success. Constaint is beaming with pride, yet how will he react when you show him the gauntlets you found?",
        "Constaint is at a loss. There is no possible explanation for how the gauntlets came to be in the assassin's possession. That they were cannot be denied, however...so what could it possibly mean?",
        "Given the manner in which they have been struggling to survive, Constaint is forced to conclude that Death's Embrace no longer has Oathkeeper. Surely they would have sold it rather than resort to banditry, he considers. Yet even more disconcerting are the gallant gauntlets, which fit Constaint perfectly─as he suspected they would...<br><br>※The next paladin quest will be available from Constaint upon reaching level 60."

        "Constaint looks as though he has suffered a tremendous shock.",
        "Hundred Eyes, friend to both Solkzagyl and Constaint, was attacked by a pack of wolves and gravely injured. Constaint went to see him earlier, only to be sent away and told to fetch you, of all people. Attend the injured man and see what he desires.",
        "Resigned to his death, Hundred Eyes asks you to dig up Solkzagyl's grave and give what you find to Constaint. As you look down on the dying man, racked with pain and guilt, you briefly consider pressing him for an explanation, but decide against it for now.",
        "Deep beneath the cold, hard earth, you find not a coffin, but a small chest containing a gallant surcoat. A cry of rage causes you to whirl about, bringing you face-to-face with Constaint, who followed you at a distance. You quickly explain yourself, further confusing the boy. After a moment, he declares that he will have answers from Hundred Eyes and makes for Falcon's Nest.",
        "Alas, whatever Hundred Eyes's reasons were, they will remain forever unknown. The craftsman succumbed to his injuries in your absence, leaving you and Constaint with no one else to press for answers─save for Papashan, who came to Falcon's Nest out of growing concern for your well-being. Stating simply that he must have words with Constaint, he asks that you meet with him at Lancegate, far to the north, and leaves.",
        "You find yourself rather unsurprised by the revelation that Solkzagyl lives, as the former captain reveals himself to be the cloaked man who observed you from atop the cliff at Camp Riversmeet. His was a complex and impenetrable plot to push Constaint towards becoming a paladin and seeking Oathkeeper of his own volition. It is not enough to reclaim Oathkeeper, he states. The sword must be won by a worthy paladin, whose soul is so pure and powerful that all others are driven to yield. However, when two souls cannot reconcile─when one cannot establish dominance, there is but one recourse: a duel. A duel to establish who is truly worthy of Oathkeeper. Though a part of him believes it to be utter nonsense, Constaint is unwilling to renounce his oaths after having come so far─and neither are you.",
        "Though he fights bravely and with conviction, Constaint is clearly no match for you. Yet the true test is yet to come. Jenlyns arrives and accuses Solkzagyl of having already recovered Oathkeeper, and the former captain at last reveals the full extent of his plans: to restore the light of the soul crystal once wielded by the first captain of the Sultansworn. In so doing, Solkzagyl hopes to infuse Oathkeeper with the resplendent light with which it once shone. Donning his armor, he demands that you face him in battle. And so you defeat him as well, establishing dominance over his and Constaint's souls.<br><br>For thirty years, as captain of the Sultansworn, Solkzagyl strove to live up to the example set by the order's founder. For thirty years, he tried to make Oathkeeper shine, as it did for the legendary captains of eld. It did, one day, but only for a fleeting moment─before it was taken from him and he forswore his oaths to reclaim it. Though you are not a true member of the order, he believes that the sword will shine for you. Gingerly taking the sword from his hands, you hold it aloft, and for a moment, the world is bathed in light. In witnessing its resplendence once more, Solkzagyl seems to find a measure of peace.<br><br>The light fades as you hand the sword to Jenlyns, but the captain does not seem to be disappointed. He invites Solkzagyl to return to Ul'dah, and the former captain agrees─though only as a friend and ally, for to leave the order is to leave it forever.",
        "Constaint struggles to say good-bye to Solkzagyl, but the paladin corrects him, stating that his business in Falcon's Nest is hardly finished, and they will meet again soon. Jenlyns, Papashan, and Solkzagyl set out for Ul'dah, and you and Constaint head back towards Falcon's Nest.",
        "Though he has yet to reconcile his feelings towards Solkzagyl, Constaint still intends to be the best free paladin he can be. He bids you farewell, but not before warning you that, should you cross blades again, he means to win.<br><br>※The next paladin quest will be available from Jenlyns once you have completed the main scenario quest “The Far Edge of Fate.”"

Her attempt to instruct you, however, is suddenly interrupted by the arrival of Captain Dancing Wolf─an Immortal Flames officer who claims to be in pursuit of the dark summoner, Tristan. Though Tristan was apparently consumed by fire at the culmination of your battle, Captain Wolf has witness accounts that place him at the scene of a merchant caravan attack. Unwilling to dismiss the possibility that the dangerous madman yet lives, Y'mhitra requests that you both be allowed to assist in the ongoing investigation. Travel to Camp Drybone in eastern Thanalan, and speak with Dancing Wolf.",

After saving him from the beastmen's spears, the merchant gratefully provides you with a description of the man responsible for the caravan attack. The silvery-haired villain appears to have been in command of Ifrit-Egi, further deepening your suspicions that Tristan is indeed still alive. Head to Ul'dah, and discuss these developments with Dancing Wolf at the Hall of Flames.",

As the dark summoner was once a soldier under his command, Dancing Wolf feels bound by duty to expunge the evil Tristan has become. Accept Y'mhitra's instruction in the damaging magicks recovered from the tomestones, and prepare for the day when you may once more face the madman's flames.<br><br>※The next summoner quest will be available from Dancing Wolf upon reaching level 54."

The surly laborer puts Dancing Wolf to work hauling rocks, and assigns you the task of retrieving chunks of fire silver stolen by the local spriggans. Investigate the spriggan scratchings, and wrest the rare ore from the clutches of the thieving soulkin.",

Y'mhitra arrives just as the laborer begins his story, and once more signals you to summon Ifrit-Egi as a means of confirming the attacker's identity. In response to the question of what motivated the villain's actions, the miner insists that Tristan was after only one thing: crystals. Return to the Hall of Flames, and discuss this worrying revelation.",
        "After reexamining various incident reports, Dancing Wolf is convinced that Tristan was behind several other recent attacks that were mistakenly attributed to the Amalj'aa. With every case involving the theft of crystals, Y'mhitra voices the concern of all present: the nefarious madman harbors plans to call forth a primal. If the atrocities of the past are to be averted in the present, then you must take full advantage of Y'mhitra's studies, and master the recovered wisdom of Allag's summoners.<br><br>※The next summoner quest will be available from Dancing Wolf upon reaching level 56."

        "After noting that Tristan's attacks have ceased since increasing trade route patrols, Dancing Wolf puts forth his plan to lure the summoner into a trap. He has arranged for a lightly guarded caravan as bait, and would have you and Y'mhitra be present to assist in engaging the dangerous mage. Make your way to Camp Bluefog in northern Thanalan, and speak with the captain to learn the details of the ambush.",
        "You arrive in Camp Bluefog, and Dancing Wolf explains his simple plan: the caravan, carrying a shipment of crystals, will conveniently break an axle on its way to the processing plant. You, Y'mhitra, and the captain are to take up positions nearby, and await Tristan's attack. Head to your assigned position, and stay alert for the black-robed madman.",
        "Lured by the promise of easy plunder, a mage and his flame-enshrouded familiar have appeared and assaulted the caravan. Defeat the ebon-clad summoner and Ifrit-Egi, and put an end to the string of callous attacks.",
        "Following a furious exchange of arcane violence, the black-robed villain lies defeated at your feet. Tend now to the wounded courier decoy.",
        "Dancing Wolf and Y'mhitra join you at the scene of the battle, after defeating opponents of their own. Upon inspecting the body of the summoner, however, the flame captain is astonished to discover that the assailant is not Tristan, but Tristan's elder brother, Kahedin. It is then that the Ascian of the Twelfth Chalice appears, lamenting his decision to employ the siblings as pawns. The Paragon proceeds to laud the primal-slaying efforts of the Bringer of Light, before vanishing as abruptly as he had appeared. Return now to the Hall of Flames in Ul'dah, and discuss these revelations with Dancing Wolf.",
        "The identity of the black-robed menace has finally been revealed as the long-dead Kahedin─a reanimated puppet of a powerful Ascian. Though Tristan and his brother are now free of the Paragon's manipulations, Dancing Wolf is intent on exacting vengeance on the callous immortal. Y'mhitra counsels caution, warning that the servants of Darkness are not to be lightly challenged. To that end, the researcher then instructs you in yet another secret of ancient Allagan magicks. Continue your efforts to master the art of summoning that you might benefit from the wisdom hidden within the remaining tomestones.<br><br>※The next summoner quest will be available from Dancing Wolf upon reaching level 58."

She goes on to explain how you might circumvent the intrinsic aetheric limitations that prevented you from summoning Ramuh-Egi by adopting a method used by the ancient Allagans─a technique known as a “trance.” After suggesting that you attempt to infuse yourself with the essence of the terrible Bahamut, she admits that you will need Captain Wolf's assistance to enter what may be the only appropriate ritual location. Make your way to Ul'dah, and speak with Dancing Wolf at the Hall of Flames.",

Wary of your newfound strength, your immortal foe chooses to withdraw rather than risk defeat. Return to Ul'dah, and speak with Dancing Wolf at the Hall of Flames.",

Theorizing that the lower-ranked Paragon is unable to possess a living being, the researcher suggests luring the villain to an unpopulated area and destroying him for good with a devastating coup de grâce. First, however, you will need to acquire a certain forbidden tome, and study the method by which the power of a trance can be unleashed in one mighty blast. Travel to the Great Gubal Library in the Dravanian hinterlands, and rendezvous with your companions.",
        "As you prepare to enter the Great Gubal Library, you are accosted by the Ascian of the Twelfth Chalice and three of his fellows. The servants of Lahabrea pronounce your demise, and furious battle is joined. Following a murderous exchange of arcane energies, you at last stand victorious over the kneeling form of your foe. The humbled Paragon once more attempts to flee, but you focus the energy of your trance and obliterate the villain with a searing flare of destructive power. Speak with Dancing Wolf, and share this triumph with your companions.",
        "Though still somewhat stunned by your display of power, Dancing Wolf at last feels that vengeance has been claimed for his wronged soldiers. The captain then praises Y'mhitra for her clever deceit, and thanks you both for your invaluable assistance in bringing the Ascian to justice before setting out on the road back to Ul'dah. Speak now with Y'mhitra, and discuss the future of summoning.",

She is, however, yet greatly concerned by the escalating threat of the primals. Though the perfect solution remains elusive, continue to work alongside the determined researcher in the quest to bring an end to the self-perpetuating cycle of violence.<br><br>※The next summoner quest will be available from Y'mhitra once you have completed the main scenario quest “The Far Edge of Fate.”"

        "Raya–O–Senna suggests that you offer your assistance with resolving some mysterious disturbance that is agitating the elementals. Make your way to the Conjurers' Guild in Gridania, and present yourself to Brother E–Sumi–Yan.",
        "The guildmaster is enthusiastic to receive your proffered aid, and soon explains why: the elementals' disquiet appears to stem from East End, the war-torn region lying on the border between Gridania and Gyr Abania, and he deems a journey into this unstable area best attempted with you at his side. Make your preparations, and meet Brother E–Sumi–Yan at Nine Ivies in the East Shroud.",
        "Upon arriving in Nine Ivies, E–Sumi–Yan confirms that the source of the disturbance is indeed originating from the direction of East End. His questing senses also reveal a guilty-looking Sylphie, who claims to be unable to ignore the keening plight of the forest spirits. The guildmaster reluctantly allows her to join your party, and the three of you make for Castrum Oriens to continue the investigation...<br><br>※The serpent officer stationed at Amarissaix's Spire in the East Shroud will grant you passage to Castrum Oriens.",
        "You rejoin Brother E–Sumi–Yan, and he suggests splitting up to search for the exact location of the disturbance. Head towards the southwest, and survey the area for anything unusual.",
        "You peer about for a sign of what might be upsetting the elementals, and are surprised to spot a child and her protective mother in the supposedly treacherous lands of East End. Aside from this unexpected encounter, however, you are unable to pinpoint the origin of the disturbance. Return to Castrum Oriens and aid the guildmaster in learning more about the area's inhabitants.",
        "Though the matter is far from resolved, Brother E–Sumi–Yan feels he has already been absent too long from Stillglade Fane. Sylphie then offers to remain in Castrum Oriens, and take up the investigation in his place. The guildmaster acquiesces...on the condition that you agree to supervise her efforts. The future promises to be full of challenges, and you will need to continue your studies if you are to be sure of meeting them.<br><br>※The next white mage quest will be available from Sylphie upon reaching level 63."

Coaxed by Sylphie's gentle words, the girl then tells you her name─Gatty─and that she and her mother live in the borderland forest. Before Sylphie can tend to her wounds, however, you are both distracted by another surge of power, and look back to find that Gatty has disappeared. Convinced that the girl and her potent aura are connected to the disturbance, Sylphie suggests that a report to Brother E–Sumi–Yan is in order.",

Return to Castrum Oriens once more, and help Sylphie with her plan to question the elusive girl at her forest home.",

The professor has been unable to prise the details out of the tight-lipped monk, but he believes that you will fare better. Make your way to Revenant's Toll, where Widargelt is based, and make yourself available to your brother-in-arms.",
        "As the professor predicts, Widargelt readily reveals to you his woes. The Ala Mhigan Resistance has invited him to rejoin the cause, and though he is resolved to turn down the offer, the event has set him to thinking about his purpose─what he can do in aid of his beleaguered homeland. O'tchakha and D'zentsa ask that you keep an eye on their master as he goes to meet with the Resistance representative in Little Ala Mhigo.",
        "You arrive in time to witness Widargelt giving Gundobald his answer. Though the old soldier expresses his understanding, saying that fighting is not the only way to serve one's nation, his words leave Widargelt wondering about his own path. Wishing to be alone, he takes his leave and heads for an unknown location. Find him and offer him your support.",
        "You find Widargelt in contemplation before the mark of the Destroyer. As he relates to you how the Fist of Rhalgr, once the foremost faith among Ala Mhigans, has all but died out in his homeland, the monk finally realizes what he must do. He bids you return with him to Revenant's Toll, where he will share his plans with everyone.",
        "Before his gathered friends and pupils, Widargelt reveals that he means to go to Gyr Abania on a mission to revive the Fist of Rhalgr. O'tchakha, D'zentsa, and the professor offer to accompany him, and naturally so do you. Overwhelmed by the support, Widargelt expresses his gratitude and determination, and bids you see to your preparations.<br><br>※The next monk quest will be available from Widargelt upon reaching level 63."

At D'zentsa's urging, he decides to strike out in the hope that inspiration will strike along the way. Your first stop is an old training ground for monks called Schism, situated in the Fringes.",
        "The visit to Schism does not avail Widargelt in his quest for a creed, but he forges on undeterred. Follow him to the village of Ala Gannha, where Professor Erik has gone ahead to scout.",
        "Arriving at the village, Widargelt witnesses a heated exchange between two villagers. The experience is the spark Widargelt needed, and he finally comes up with a fitting doctrine to guide the Fist of Rhalgr into a new age. With that, he is ready to proclaim the order's return to the world. As the foremost monk in the party, you have been tasked with performing a demonstration before the villagers. Let Widargelt know when you are ready to begin.",

        "In no small part due to your aid, Widargelt has taken a first momentous step towards reviving the Fist of Rhalgr. The monk will remain in Ala Gannha awhile to initiate interested villagers into the fundamentals of the faith. In the meantime, he bids you continue honing your skills, for they will doubtless be called upon again ere long.<br><br>※The next monk quest will be available from Widargelt upon reaching level 65."

        "While Widargelt is pleased with his growing membership of students, there are villagers still who doubt the authenticity of his style. In order to win them over, he plans to host a cross-discipline match pitting monks against pugilists. As a well-known face among the Pugilists' Guild, you have been tasked with delivering the invitation. Make your way to Ul'dah and broach the subject with Hamon.",
        "You arrive at the Pugilists' Guild to find not only Hamon and Chuchuto, but Rurukuta as well, temporarily returned from his wanderings. All are responsive to the idea of a cross-discipline match, and the guildmaster formally accepts. Make your way back to Ala Gannha and inform Widargelt of the pugilists' coming.",
        "Widargelt is ecstatic to learn that Hamon has accepted the invitation, and he sets about preparing for the match. He bids you meet him directly in the Fringes at Schism, the chosen venue.",
        "No sooner do you arrive at Schism than cries ring out from the river─D'zentsa and O'tchakha are in danger. Hasten after Widargelt to their aid.",
        "You find Widargelt on his knees, handily bested by a band of men led by the mysterious Theobald, who claims to be the Griffin and the rightful King of Ala Mhigo both. He issues a stern warning against reviving the Fist of Rhalgr, and goes on to reveal that Widargelt is in fact his cousin, Theodred, who was raised at the Temple of the Fist in order to spare him the King of Ruin's wrath. Theobald then leaves, but not before declaring his intent to rule Ala Mhigo with an iron fist. With the immediate danger passed, you may turn your attention to your comrades.",
        "In light of recent events, Widargelt has no choice but to call off the match, and he apologetically sends Hamon and his crew back to Ul'dah. While Widargelt checks on his pupils, take word of these troubling developments to Erik, now returned to Ala Gannha from his fieldwork.",
        "Erik is unable to hide his shock at your report. The veracity of Theobald's words aside, the professor posits that his minions are members of the Corpse Brigade─elite soldiers trained in counter-monk combat, who once served Theodoric as his personal guard. Erik promises to investigate the many claims made, and bids you look in on Widargelt.",
        "You find Widargelt deeply discouraged, not only by the sound drubbing he received but also the shocking revelation of his origin. For now, give your brother monk the time and space he requires.<br><br>※The next monk quest will be available from Widargelt upon reaching level 68."

        "You look in on D'zentsa and O'tchakha, who in turn express their concern for their master. Uncertain what to do, they decide to turn to the ever-insightful Erik. While they keep an eye on the despairing Widargelt, they bid you fetch the professor from Rhalgr's Reach, home of the Resistance, where he is making his inquiries.",
        "You find Erik just as he finishes asking Resistance soldiers about the mysterious Theobald. After sharing with you his findings, he agrees to accompany you back to Ala Gannha to have a stern word with Widargelt.",
        "Widargelt has largely come to terms with his defeat; rather, the revelation of his true identity as the nephew of the King of Ruin has made him question his fitness to revive the Fist of Rhalgr. Through a tale about his departed son, Erik teaches Widargelt that a man is defined not by his blood, but by the choices he makes. His vigor and purpose thus restored, Widargelt turns his attention to what must be done. He reveals his suspicion that Theobald is in fact someone known to him: a brother from the Temple of the Fist named Adri, whom he had long believed dead. If it comes to it, Widargelt stands ready to strike him down, and he asks that you train him and his disciples in the way of the pugilist, that they might defeat the Corpse Brigade. Make your way to the old training grounds and begin their training.",
        "Widargelt and his disciples prove eager students, and they quickly grasp the fundamentals of pugilism. As you train, a man named Hewerald arrives bearing the news that Erik has made a momentous discovery pertaining to Theobald. While your students continue their training, you decide to follow the messenger to East End, where the professor awaits.",
        "The meeting with Erik turns out to be a trap, and you are forced to defend yourself. As you gain the upper hand, however, the battle transforms into a hostage situation. Just when it seems you must surrender, Widargelt and his disciples come to the rescue, having used their newfound fighting skills to overwhelm the sentries posted around the forest.",
        "With the enemy thus routed, you may turn your attention to the liberated Erik.",
        "Erik is well considering his ordeal, and your friends set out for Ala Gannha. Join them back at the village and speak with Widargelt to learn of his plans.",
        "Widargelt declares his intent to challenge Theobald and put an end to his tyrannical ambitions. As your brother monk prepares for the encounter, see to it that you hone your own fists and feet.<br><br>※The next monk quest will be available from Widargelt upon reaching level 70."

But before fists fly, it is revealed that Theobald is in fact Adri, Widargelt's dear comrade from his time at the Temple of the Fist. Made to feel powerless due to his low birth, he resents Widargelt for spurning his royal blood and the might it represents. Once the talking ends and they engage, it becomes clear that Widargelt has the upper hand, and Adri summons his minions to his aid and resorts to using imperial weaponry. For a blessing, Hamon appears with Chuchuto and Rurukuta, having been informed of the duel, and they join the fray to even the odds. At the end of a long struggle, you and yours emerge triumphant.",

D'zentsa and O'tchakha, meanwhile, reaffirm their resolve to grow stronger, that they might better support their master in his endeavors. Last but not least, Erik expresses his gratitude for the role you played in helping Widargelt to forge on in the face of adversity. With the others having taken their leave, you may now give your undivided attention to your brother monk.",

Gladdened by your intent to participate, Jenlyns instructs you to seek out the tournament registrar on the Royal Promenade.",

Mylla sees no harm in obliging the man, who asks that you come to the Quicksand.",

Noticing you afterwards, Black Lotus gives his hasty assurance that all is well, though he asks that your meeting be postponed. Your business thus prematurely concluded, you may return to the Gladiators' Guild to report to Mylla.",

With the Ul Cup final fast approaching, you would do well to dedicate yourself to preparing for an encounter that promises to go down in Ul'dahn history.<br><br>※The next paladin quest will be available from Mylla upon reaching level 68."

Though this makes you the champion by default, such an unearned victory rings hollow to you. Perhaps your guildmaster can provide some clarity amid the confusion.",

He explains that he withdrew from the tournament in order to save a boy he met during his wanderings, whom unscrupulous match-fixers took hostage in the mistaken belief that he is Aldis's own. At this time an unimpressed Mylla arrives, and Aldis goes on to reveal that rumors of your surpassing skills are what drew him back to Ul'dah. His mention of a child leaves her dismayed, but the questions must wait, for the boy has yet to be released. Aldis means to track down the abductors and mount a rescue, and bids you ask after shady sorts in Pearl Lane.",

After a brief but warm reunion, Aldis informs you that he has found solid evidence implicating Odde, the detestable Lalafell from the Quicksand, in the match-fixing attempt. And then to Mylla's relief, he clarifies that the boy is not in fact his own. All is well, then, save for the fact that a dream match between you and Aldis was not to be. However, Mylla tells you not to give up, for she believes she can convince the organizers to host the Ul Cup final. Leaving to entrust the child to the Brass Blades' care, she bids you join her back at the guild afterwards.",

Though the crowd is initially shocked, Mylla succeeds in rallying everyone behind the match. At this time, Nanamo steps in and gives her blessing for the contest to proceed. With no obstacles left to bar your way, you and Aldis finally square off. At the end of a furious clash, you emerge the victor and are crowned champion of the Ul Cup. Nanamo makes to present you with the promised tome of secret techniques, but Papashan confesses that such an item never existed. The true purpose in bringing together the highest names in swordplay, he explains, was to raise the gladiatorial arts higher, with the ultimate goal of strengthening the realm in the face of multiple threats. At length, Nanamo turns her attention to the question of Aldis's banishment, and by a simple utterance grants him a royal pardon.",

Mylla protests, but he will not be swayed; his defeat to you made it clear he still wants for experience, and he will not know peace until he has gained it. As Aldis departs, he expresses his eagerness to meet you again in battle. In anticipation of that day, you resolve to continue striving for greater heights in your art.<br><br>※The next paladin quest will be available from Jenlyns once you have met the following requirements:<br>※ FINAL FANTASY XIV: Shadowbringers must be registered to your service account.<br>※ You must have completed the main scenario quest “Shadowbringers.”<br>※ You must have completed the role quest “To Have Loved and Lost.”"

        "Lalai eagerly shares with you a new and most fascinating discovery. In poring over the reunited Books of Nald'thal, she has unearthed what appears to be a long-lost incantation. Entirely unfamiliar to her, the spell is accompanied by only a concise instruction urging the would-be caster to speak the words at Nald's Reflection. Convinced that Master Ququruka meant to bequeath some profound knowledge to his pupil, Lalai dashes off, making it all too clear that she expects you to follow close behind.",
        "At Lalai's behest, you invoke the spell according to the instructions writ in the tome. No sooner have the words left your mouth than a wisp of light emerges from the chalice of the statue of Nald. It then floats across the room, stopping before you in an ominous warning before striking the body of your companion in full force. Not moments later, Lalai is no longer herself, but speaking to you in the voice of none other than Shatotto─the storied mother of black magic herself. No sooner has the mighty sorceress introduced herself to you than she brandishes her staff in your general direction, eager to test whether you are worthy of aiding her in performing some cryptic-yet-vital task. Summoning forth all the strength you can muster, you hold the sorceress and her array of destructive incantations at bay, a development which seems to please her greatly.",
        "Relieved to see that you indeed possess the strength she seeks, Shatotto at last deigns to share with you the true reason for her return. She has scarce begun to describe the impending danger, however, when her strength begins to fade. Moments later, she is gone, and Lalai once again regains control of her own consciousness. At a loss for how to proceed, she proposes that you return to the Sacrarium to further discuss the matter at hand.",
        "Though Shatotto's sudden appearance has raised more questions than answers, one thing is clear: there are dark clouds on the horizon. As Lalai returns to the study of the tomes in hopes of gleaning further answers, you return to your study of the black arts, that you might be better equipped to face the challenges to come.<br><br>※The next black mage quest will be available from Lalai upon reaching level 63."

        "You are discussing the matter of Shatotto's sudden appearance with Lalai when Zhai'a Nelhah dashes breathlessly onto the scene. The Hearer brings grave tidings from the Twelveswood─a pack of golems has escaped from the ruins of the Lost City of Amdapor and now threatens to run roughshod over the forest. As if spurred to action, the memory of Shatotto stirs, and dashes off with Lalai's corporeal body in tow to see to the threat as only she knows how. At the Hearer's behest, you make for the Shroud to see what news the Wailer Alphene has of the threat.",
        "Alphene is at a loss, but the ever-insightful Shatotto surmises that the golems you seek are hiding in plain sight. Fortunately, she has a means to tell inanimate stone from foe. Incinerate any suspicious-looking stone structures with your most potent fire magic, and lay waste to any rampaging golems that might manifest themselves in the process.",
        "Following Shatotto's advice to the letter, you make short work of three meddlesome golems. Seek out Shatotto and hope that she is as pleased with your efforts as she undoubtedly is with her own.",
        "At least moderately impressed with your command of the destructive arts, Shatotto deigns to share with you and your friends the nature of the threat the realm faces. As she tells it, two millennia ago when she still lived, a wayward comet threatened to crash into the city of Mhach─a crisis averted by the power of black magic, an art which she had devised at least in part for that very task. Fragments that broke off the comet hurtled to the earth, and were later unearthed, affording the mages of the realm untold powers. There remains, however, a further complication. Shatotto posits that the stones call out to each other with aetheric signals, augmenting each other's power─a phenomenon which could result in disaster should the comet once again draw near, as Shatotto predicts will happen in the days to come. Zhai'a Nelhah is naturally skeptical, but nonetheless is determined to do his part to see that the realm does not come to peril. Reconvene with your friends at Milvaneth Sacrarium, that you might formulate a plan of attack.",
        "Back at the Sacrarium, Shatotto returns to her slumber, and you are rejoined by Lalai. After a testy exchange with Zhai'a Nelhah─who is skeptical of Shatotto's methods, if not her intentions─she goes off to consult with your beastman allies, encouraging you to devote yourself to your studies that you might be prepared for the trials to come.<br><br>※The next black mage quest will be available from Lalai upon reaching level 65."

A missive from 269th Order Mendicant Da Za in Revenant's Toll speaks of further golem sightings. Seek out your kobold friend, that you might gain whatever knowledge necessary to stave off attacks that might endanger your beastman friends.",
        "A brief conversation with Da Za reveals that the particular golems rampaging in the area appear to be of Mhachi construction. Shatotto, who has once again assumed control of Lalai's consciousness, expresses her disbelief that constructs she herself played a part in creating could be behaving in such a manner, leading the ever-wary Zhai'a Nelhah to doubt her motivations. You set out for the Tangle, where the golems were last sighted, in hopes of finding further answers.",
        "No sooner have you arrived in the Tangle than Shatotto senses a strong aetheric presence and promptly dashes off in pursuit. Zhai'a Nelhah follows her, meaning to keep an eye on the sorceress and golems both, while bidding you to survey the far side of the bog, to ensure that no menaces of living stone lie in wait.",
        "Your foray to the southeastern reaches of the swamp proves uneventful. Return to the southwest, that you might see how your companions fared in their own scouting effort.",
        "You arrive on the scene just in time to rescue the embattled Shatotto and Zhai'a Nelhah from the mindless wrath of a golem gone berserk. Shatotto, in particular, seems uncharacteristically shaken up by the ordeal. Tend to the sorceress and see that neither she nor her host Lalai has suffered grave injury.",
        "Shatotto and Zhai'a Nelhah have at long last come to something of a mutual understanding, and all it took was staring certain death in the eye together on the field of battle. The conversation turns to the subject of Lalai, and Shatotto chastises the stodgy Hearer for his pathetically hopeless understanding of the fairer sex, causing him to flee from the scene a blithering mess. Shatotto also takes her leave, sensing that she is about to fall back into slumber, and bids you return to Ul'dah to consult with Lalai when she wakes.",
        "Lalai welcomes you back to Ul'dah and explains that Shatotto has once again returned to rest, though not before sharing her plans for the next stage of your mission: to wit, she would venture further afield to fend off any potential golem rampages at the pass. Lalai encourages you to continue your studies with due diligence. Though you know not when the call will come, come it will, and Shatotto will be ill pleased if you are not up to the task.<br><br>※The next black mage quest will be available from Lalai upon reaching level 68."

And so it is that you and Lalai set out for Burgundy Falls in the hopes of conferring with your beastman allies.",
        "No sooner have your allies given you a warm welcome than you are joined once more by the reawakened memory of Shatotto, who shares her latest insights into the golem menace. It would appear that the greatest threat is posed not by the man-made creatures that you have faced thus far, but rather self-animated monstrosities formed of materials attracted by the burgeoning aetheric power of the gemstones. In hopes of assessing the true nature of the threat, the Hearer Zhai'a Nelhah sets out in one direction in the company of the beastman trio, entrusting you and Shatotto to look into troubling reports from the village of Ala Gannha.",
        "You arrive in Ala Gannha to find no sign of the animated monstrosities you seek. At Shatotto's suggestion, you split up to cover more ground and properly survey the surrounding wilderness.",
        "Your search bears fruit, as you come to discover─and promptly dispatch─two golems made of wood that would seem to prove Shatotto's hypothesis. Venture back to the east and see how the sorceress fares.",
        "You find Shatotto standing over the crumpled forms of two golems who were unfortunate enough to have crossed her path. She congratulates you on your own efforts, then shares a troubling sight she witnessed. As she tells it, the golems are turning upon each other, as if driven by an animal instinct to seek greater and greater power. Your conversation is interrupted by a linkpearl transmission from Zhai'a Nelhah, who claims to have witnessed a still more fearsome sight─a veritable legion of golems assembling in Dravania for purposes unknown. As Shatotto and the Hearer make for the Observatorium to see what has been learned of the comet, you set off on a return path to Burgundy Falls, that you and your beastman friends might discuss your next course of action.",
        "Putting together all the knowledge at your disposal, Shatotto is able to reason out the golems' ultimate goal: they converge as one upon Sohm Al in hopes of summoning the ultimate source of power─the calamitous comet Shatotto blasted out of the heavens some two thousand years ago─back to Eorzea, where they would feast upon its aether. In the face of certain doom, Shatotto reveals her master plan: put simply, you will wait for the golems to cannibalize each other time and again until but a single golem remains. You will then confront this creation─the mother of all golems, as it were─and blast it to tiny fragments with the power of your black magic. For whatever it is worth, Shatotto and Zhai'a Nelhah appear to have the utmost confidence in your ability to succeed in this daunting task. As Shatotto prepares to return to slumber in anticipation of the final confrontation, you, too, make for Ul'dah, that you might speak with Lalai one last time before resuming your studies.",
        "You return to the Sacrarium to find Lalai having regained her consciousness, with a message from Shatotto instructing you to ready yourself well for the battle to come. You take your leave, determined to master the art of destruction to levels heretofore scarcely fathomed.<br><br>※The next black mage quest will be available from Lalai upon reaching level 70."

Confident that you have primed your powers to the fullest, Lalai bids you join her─which is to say Shatotto─the Hearer Zhai'a Nelhah, and your beastman friends before the entrance to Anyx Trine. Prepare as you must and be on your way.",
        "At Anyx Trine, Shatotto─who has once again roused herself from slumber─briefs you on the plan of attack. Before doing battle on the sacred peak of Sohm Al, however, Zhai'a Nelhah would have you seek the blessing of the dragons who call this place home. Shatotto consents to the proposal, and you set off to seek a word with your old friend Vidofnir.",
        "You are relieved to hear that Vidofnir, too, did sense the golem menace, and has no objection with your proposed course of action. Shatotto, for her part, is eager that the dragons will not stand in the way of the destruction she hopes to wreak. As your beastman friends deal with the straggling golems attempting to scale the mountains, you prepare to scale the peak with the sorceress and Zhai'a Nelhah to do battle with the abomination that awaits you.",
        "The mother of all golems is no more, and the comet that threatened to reduce the realm to rubble has sailed safely off to the heavens, with any fortune never to return.",

Lalai offers her own words of praise, before promptly getting into another tiff with her eternal nemesis Zhai'a Nelhah. Leaving the Hearer behind to reflect upon matters of etiquette, you and Lalai set off to share tidings of your triumph with your beastman friends.",
        "The beastmen rejoice upon hearing of your victory, and celebrate a triumphant day in the annals of black magic before taking their leave, proud to have reaffirmed your mutual friendship. Even Lalai and Zhai'a Nelhah come to a grudging but strong mutual acceptance─as the black mage thanks the Hearer for his efforts, and the Hearer promises to work for a day where practitioners of the black arts need no longer toil in the shadows. After Zhai'a cordially departs, Lalai invites you back to the Sacrarium to reflect upon the events of the day.",
        "Reflecting on the Hearer's parting words, Lalai has made a resolution. She vows to follow the lead of Master Ququruka, putting every detail of your adventures together to paper in hopes that one day, the duties of your illustrious forebear and her friends will be known to the realm at large. Expressing her deep admiration for your profound mastery of the dark arts, she flashes a rare smile, deeply moved to have found another important calling in her life.<br><br>※The next black mage quest will be available from Lalai once you have met the following requirements:<br>※ FINAL FANTASY XIV: Shadowbringers must be registered to your service account.<br>※ You must have completed the main scenario quest “Shadowbringers.”<br>※ You must have completed the role quest “A Tearful Reunion.”"

        "Y'mhitra carefully cracks open the tome's covers, and the both of you are caught off guard as the book suddenly jumps from her hands and introduces itself as “Principia.” According to the animate familiar, it was created as an instruction manual for promising summoners, but can only share its higher knowledge once the student in question has completed three formidable challenges. The first of these challenges is to be a test of power. Follow Y'mhitra out into the wilds of north Silvertear, and ask Principia to call forth your monstrous opponent.",
        "You have defeated the demon of the tome. Share your victory with the nearby Y'mhitra.",
        "It appears your victory over the tome's demon was more than satisfactory, but despite its glowing praise, “Prin” gives the impression that your technique is far from perfect. Amazed at this evaluation and intrigued by the tale of the familiar's creation, Y'mhitra seems lost in contemplation of the past. Return to Gridania, and rejoin the scholar at Apkallu Falls.",
        "Y'mhitra praises you on your triumph once more, and speaks eagerly of revealing the lost knowledge hidden within the tome. Before you can attempt Prin's next challenge, however, it seems you will need to work on perfecting your technique.<br><br>※The next summoner quest will be available from Y'mhitra upon reaching level 63."

        "You join Y'mhitra and the others on Azys Lla, and the scholar urges you to begin the search for a control panel of some kind. Head towards your assigned area near the statues of the Warring Triad, and seek out a research facility terminal.",
        "You approach a promising control panel only to find yourself set upon by a trio of clockwork soldiers. After defeating your ambushers, you once more stretch forth a hand to operate the terminal...",
        "Your efforts at the terminal are rewarded by the appearance of Sari, who then proceeds to lay his challenge at your feet. Your companions arrive in time to witness the exchange, and Y'mhitra suggests that the “clone” is, in fact, some manner of summoned entity. Her observation seems supported by the evidence at hand, but gives rise to yet another question: who, then, is the summoner? Prepare yourself to face the formidable egi, then speak with Captain Wolf when you are ready to enter the facility.",
        "After a shocking revelation, you discover that the strings of the Sari-egi were being pulled by a sentient machine─an invention of Sari's which describes itself as an “evocation matrix.” All attempts to reason with the warped intelligence fail, and you and your companions are drawn into a battle of surreal proportions. Despite the bewildering capabilities of your opponent, however, you seize victory over the mechanical summoner. Join Y'mhitra by the statues of the Warring Triad, and discuss the aftermath of the battle.",
        "With the evocation matrix destroyed, you have removed the final barrier to learning the secrets held within Principia's pages. Say your farewells to the summoning squad, and return to Gridania with Y'mhitra.",
        "Upon your return, Captain Wolf shares the results of his last-moment investigation. He reports that he salvaged a number of soul crystals from the wreckage of the machine, as well as an accompanying record which explains the master summoner's descent into a bitter pessimism. You muse over Sari's disparate attempts to bequeath summoning to future generations, and the philosophical differences evident in the construction of Principia and the evocation matrix. The familiar itself seems satisfied to have entrusted you with its creator's knowledge, and content to leave the succession of summoning magic in your capable hands. Principia returns to its slumber, its purpose fulfilled...for now.<br><br>※The next summoner quest will be available from Y'mhitra once you have met the following requirements:<br>※ FINAL FANTASY XIV: Shadowbringers must be registered to your service account.<br>※ You must have completed the main scenario quest “Shadowbringers.”<br>※ You must have completed the role quest “A Tearful Reunion.”"

Head to Nine Ivies in the East Shroud and seek out the letter's mysterious sender.",

Masked bandits have been terrorizing the area of late, and your fellow bard would have you investigate a Twin Adder scout who is late to report back.

Putting two and two together, Guydelot suggests that the bandits may also be after the tome. The possibility seems to rattle Nourval, who excuses himself in spite of Sanson's protests. At this time, Guydelot reveals that Nourval has been stealing out of the castrum while your backs are turned. Sanson decides to allow Nourval to act freely in order to learn his true purpose, and bids you stand at the ready for whatever may come to pass.<br><br>※The next bard quest will be available from Sanson upon reaching level 65."

In order to catch the man red-handed, Sanson has contrived to lure him out of the castrum with his guard lowered. Find Nourval inside the stronghold and lead him into thinking that the way is clear.",
        "You inform Nourval that your two comrades are tied up, and the man takes the bait and hastens away. Join Sanson outside the castrum.",
        "Sanson is pleased that his ploy has worked, and even now Guydelot shadows Nourval to his destination. Make your way to the ruin called Gyr Kehim to the northeast and join your fellow bard on the chase.",
        "You catch Nourval meeting with the masked bandits, who have found the tome you seek─the journal of the Ala Mhigan general Gylbarde. Eavesdropping on their conversation, you learn their true purpose: stoking the fires of anti-Ala Mhigan sentiment. Determined not to let this come to pass, your party confronts Nourval's, and at the end of a fierce confrontation, you emerge the victor and with the journal in your hands.",
        "The defeated Nourval flees the scene, but not before revealing that he is descended from Vainchelon. And in turn, the journal reveals that Vainchelon did not die of illness as is believed, but rather was poisoned by Gylbarde at a secret meeting. The revelation comes as a shock to Sanson and Guydelot, who worry what may happen should the truth be made public knowledge. There is clearly much to mull over; for now, return to Castrum Oriens with your comrades.",
        "Back at Castrum Oriens, Sanson shares with you further details from the journal. It appears that one of Vainchelon's sons was present at the deadly meeting, and he alone managed to escape with his life. But rather than tell of events as they happened, he kept the truth of his sire's demise a secret. Even as the man's motive boggles him, Sanson must turn his attention to his own dilemma: deciding what to do with Gylbarde's journal. Though he knows in his mind that the truth is best kept buried, in his heart he is not wholly convinced, and begs you for more time to consider the matter.<br><br>※The next bard quest will be available from Sanson upon reaching level 68."

As Guydelot lets vent his fury at the heartless decision, Commander Heuloix emerges as an ally, revealing that he has already recruited the aid of Gridania's martial guilds for Sanson's rescue. Speak with Luciane and Ywain at the Archers' and Lancers' Guilds respectively, and inform them that the mission will soon commence.",
        "Both the archers and the lancers are ready to strike out. Take word back to Commander Heuloix at the Adders' Nest.",
        "In urgent tones, Commander Heuloix informs you that the Order of the Twin Adder has ascertained Nourval's hideout, and will soon deploy troops for an assault. Unless you get there first, Sanson is as good as dead. Make haste to the North Shroud, and join Guydelot at Alder Springs.",
        "With help from your allies, you succeed in subduing Nourval and liberating Sanson. Rejoin your comrades in the North Shroud.",
        "At first, Nourval clings to his hatred for Ala Mhigo, but confronted with the truth of his ancestors' hearts, he is forced to concede the error of his ways. Reaching out to his erstwhile captor, Sanson swears to see to it that Vainchelon's sacrifice is not forgotten. With the situation now under control, turn your attention to Sanson and ensure that he is well.",
        "Thanking you for his preservation, Sanson declares his intent to make good on his promise to Nourval. Return with your comrades to Gridania, and seek out Commander Heuloix at the Adders' Nest.",
        "Commander Heuloix listens intently as Sanson states his terms for surrendering Gylbarde's journal: when the time is right, the Order of the Twin Adder must release the truth of Vainchelon's death to the public. The commander promises to do all within his power to make it so, and encourages Sanson to rise through the ranks that he, too, might join his voice to the cause. While Guydelot keeps watch over his recovering chief, seek out Jehantel at his campsite west of Quarrymill, and report the conclusion of events.",
        "Jehantel expresses his hopes that Nourval will find a new path─one that leads to peace in the world and in his heart. With you and yours leading the way, the ideals of peace and harmony may yet be restored to Vainchelon's line, made bolder still by a true remembrance of the past.<br><br>※The next bard quest will be available from Jehantel once you have met the following requirements:<br>※ FINAL FANTASY XIV: Shadowbringers must be registered to your service account.<br>※ You must have completed the main scenario quest “Shadowbringers.”<br>※ You must have completed the role quest “Courage Born of Fear.”"

Though no one knows who these combatants are, they seem quite familiar with you and your exploits, as they have requested your attendance as well. Not one to disappoint, Curious Gorge wastes no time in traveling to the Moraby Drydocks to meet with his brother.",

Though Wyrnzoen is at a loss as to why she refuses to yield, the look in her eyes says it all─she has been blinded by the rage of her inner beast. Tossing Wyrnzoen, Broenbhar, and even Curious Gorge into the waters of the pier, you and Broken Mountain are left to subdue this savage beast alone.",
        "Having returned to her senses, the young marauder introduces herself as Dorgono of the Qerel clan. The inner beast is not a foreign concept to her people, but they lack the understanding to control it. Because of this, those like her who are influenced by it are exiled. She has ventured to Eorzea to hone her skills in the hopes of mastering her inner beast. Broken Mountain readily accepts Dorgono as a new charge. Curious Gorge, on the other hand, deems himself unfit to train her and chooses to train on his own.",

He turns to you for assistance, knowing that only you are capable of defeating Dorgono should she lose herself to her inner beast. For now he bids you rest, while he considers how best to go about her training.<br><br>※The next warrior quest will be available from Broken Mountain upon reaching level 63."

        "Broken Mountain has decided on how he might begin training Dorgono. As he prepares to help her gain mastery of her inner beast, however, he cannot help but worry for Curious Gorge, who claims his inner beast has fallen silent. Sadly there is no time to lament further, for the Maelstrom has requested the aid of Broken Mountain's troop of warriors to rout a band of outlaw Mamool Ja. He sees this as an opportunity for Dorgono, as he believes building a resolve to defend her allies will allow her to gain control of her inner beast. He readies his men, and makes for the ruins of Nym in outer La Noscea.",
        "With everyone assembled, Broken Mountain explains to you his plan. With Dorgono in tow, he means to take his band of warriors along the Long Climb and sweep through the Mamool Ja's main force. Meanwhile, you are to sneak through the heart of the ruins and pick off the sentries. With everyone assigned their orders, you split up, seeking to rendezvous on the path leading toward the Hermit's Hovel.",
        "As you navigate the heart of the Nym ruins, you spy two Mamool Ja brawlers and trounce them swiftly and quietly. Perhaps there are other sentries still in the area.",
        "You come upon another pair of Mamool Ja fighters and take them unawares. As the coast seems to be clear, you continue along the path through the ruins in search of the others.",
        "Broken Mountain and his men are no worse for wear, and Dorgono showed no signs of succumbing to her inner beast in battle. Yet her calm and cool composure was not cause for celebration. Curious Gorge─taking an innocent stroll through the ruins of Nym─happened to see her fighting, and noticed that Dorgono was holding back. Though she only meant to spare her comrades the risk of her inner beast, this means she has yet to harness the power raging within her. Nevertheless, the Mamool Ja have been routed, and Maelstrom shipments may now pass through safely. All that remains is to return to the Moraby Drydocks and rest.",
        "Everyone is safely returned to the Moraby Drydocks─everyone except Curious Gorge. Strange that he would stumble upon your mission in the ruins of Nym. Broken Mountain believes it is related to the source of Curious Gorge's personal dilemma, but assures you it is nothing to worry about. For now he bids you rest, and prepare for the next step in Dorgono's training.<br><br>※The next warrior quest will be available from Broken Mountain upon reaching level 65."

        "The Mamool Ja's defeat at the ruins of Nym was not enough to dissuade them, as Maelstrom Command reports indicate they have now set their sights on Wineport. It goes without saying Broken Mountain means to repel the Mamool Ja once more. It should also come as no surprise that he expects you to accompany him on this mission. Not wishing to waste time, he makes haste to Raincatcher Gully, asking you to meet him there when you are geared for battle.",
        "As Broken Mountain goes over his plan for defending Wineport, Dorgono is disappointed to hear she has been relegated to support. Though he fears the risk of her losing control, he admits that this decision leaves them wanting for muscle. How fortunate, then, that Curious Gorge should again happen upon your gathering in the middle of Raincatcher Gully. With the aid of his axe, Broken Mountain will lead his men on a westerly route past the Severed String, while you head due south dispensing with any enemies who stand in your way.",
        "As you make your way through Raincatcher Gully, you are assaulted by two Mamool Ja warriors. The odds are sadly not in their favor as a few heavy swings of your axe make short work of them. You continue along the path south, your axe at the ready.",
        "Another gang of Mamool Ja fighters soon come into view. Though greater in number, they are still no match for your combat prowess. Still clutching your axe, you venture deeper into the wilds.",
        "Yet another band of Mamool Ja dare to stand in your way. Yet there is little they can do to stand against your terrible might. As you continue along the path, you see a familiar figure in the distance.",
        "You find Broken Mountain and his men, battered and beaten. As he explains it, they were ambushed and Curious Gorge was the first to fall. Dorgono, also unable to escape, is likely fighting for her life against the Mamool Ja. He bids you find them before it is too late.",
        "You find Curious Gorge wounded, Dorgono towering over the mangled bodies of the Mamool Ja. She turns to look at you with what seems to be murderous intent, but suddenly her eyes soften. Lowering her axe she realizes she has managed to suppress her inner beast. Curious Gorge, bearing witness to this mastery of self, sees her accomplishment as a source of ignominy. As he takes leave of the scene, too embarrassed to face the others, Broken Mountain and his men stagger over to congratulate Dorgono. They then return to the Moraby Drydocks to bid her a final farewell.",
        "Dorgono, now able to control her inner beast, means to return home and win back the trust of her people. However, there is still the matter of Curious Gorge and his now dormant inner beast. Broken Mountain is convinced his brother now faces a crisis the likes of which he has never known: he has fallen in love. Dorgono has left him a whirlwind of emotions, but time heals all wounds. Broken Mountain suggests giving his brother space to cope with these emotions on his own.<br><br>※The next warrior quest will be available from Broken Mountain upon reaching level 68."

The ones responsible for besieging their homes were the very same people they exiled from the Qerel clan. They have created an order of their own, the Chaghan, and believe the blind fury of their inner beasts is a gift from their goddess, the Dusk Mother. The Qerel believe Dorgono to be one of the Chaghan now, and refuse to allow her back. She is now determined to avenge her people and earn back their trust. Your help, and even Curious Gorge's, will be indispensable in this endeavor. As she leaves to go track their whereabouts, she suggests you return to Reunion to rest up and prepare for battle.",

        "Curious Gorge seems surprisingly calm and collected.",
        "In an unusual change of pace, Curious Gorge has taken to helping merchants of Reunion with errands. He has been recently tasked with taking two horses up to Mol Iloh, but is wary of leaving one without a rider. He asks you to speak with the horses' owner, so you might saddle up to assist him.",
        "The sprightly merchant is only too happy to ready his horse for you. Mounted and ready to ride, he wishes you save travels to Mol Iloh.",
        "As you arrive at Mol Iloh, a sheepherder approaches you. His look of satisfaction makes clear that he is the intended recipient of the horse. With the delivery complete, you look for Curious Gorge who should be nearby.",
        "Robbed of his inner beast and ability to battle, Curious Gorge has thought long and hard about what life has to offer off the battlefield. He realizes now the vexing emotion which inhibited his inner beast was the love he bears for Dorgono. This understanding of his feelings has also reawakened his once-dormant strength. To cast aside any lingering feelings of doubt or hesitation, he plans to profess his love to her. To that end, he bids you follow him back to Reunion.",
        "Both Curious Gorge and Dorgono have been waiting for your return. His look of exasperation makes it clear he has buckled under pressure. Your presence offers him a modicum of courage, but before he can say a word, she interrupts him to relay grave news to you─the Chaghan have grown bolder, and now plan to attack Mol Iloh. She means to cut them off before they can reach the settlement and leaves ahead of you. Curious Gorge grows increasingly frustrated with himself, and asks you to give him the one thing certain to dispel his fear─the realm-shattering slap of Eorzea's greatest warrior!",
        "It is all Curious Gorge can do not to fall to the ground from the force of your mighty blow. He is now duly inspired and ready to help Dorgono rout the Chaghan.",
        "You find Dorgono south of the settlement, surveying the area for the Chaghan. The silent operation is foiled, however, by the boisterous bellowing of Curious Gorge as he attempts to profess his love to her. Your cover blown, a fierce battle with the Chaghan soon ensues. The song of steel echoes across the Azim Steppe, and after the final refrain, you find yourselves victorious. Or so it seems. The Chaghan are defeated, but the threat of danger still looms in Curious Gorge who has been overcome by his inner beast. Though he seems beyond reasoning, it is a confession of love from Dorgono that brings him back to his senses.",
        "Love is in the air, and Dorgono asks Curious Gorge to return with her to start anew as part of the Qerel clan. With a heavy heart he declines. Control of his inner beast still eludes him, and he cannot suffer the thought of hurting the one he loves most. He vows to become the realm's second─or third─strongest warrior, hoping to someday be worthy of her affection. Dorgono bids you both farewell and departs to at last rejoin her people.",
        "Curious Gorge is a man of his word, and jokingly warns you that, should you decide to rest on your laurels for even a moment, he intends to rob you of your title of realm's greatest warrior. That said, he concedes you both have earned rest after such a grueling battle. Longing for home, you both return to Limsa Lominsa.",
        "Broken Mountain is relieved to see you both returned safely, hopeful that things would return to as they were. Unfortunately that would not be the case. Still struggling to control his inner beast, Curious Gorge again relinquishes his position as instructor to resume training at Hidden Falls. Though his brother is certain to emerge from his training a warrior transformed, Broken Mountain hopes you will answer their call should the realm want for a mighty axe.<br><br>※The next warrior quest will be available from Curious Gorge once you have met the following requirements:<br>※ FINAL FANTASY XIV: Shadowbringers must be registered to your service account.<br>※ You must have completed the main scenario quest “Shadowbringers.”<br>※ You must have completed the role quest “To Have Loved and Lost.”"

        "Ser Alberic is keen to regale you with Dravanian legends.",

He hands you a piece of parchment detailing the first tale he suggests you investigate, taking care to mention that the Congregation priest emphasized these stories can rarely be taken at face value. You set off to relay this information to Heustienne and Orn Khai.",
        "The legend Ser Alberic has dug up concerns the Slumbering Wyrm of Gyr Abania. Orn Khai is initially distracted upon seeing the parchment, as dragons do not have a written language; they pass down their history through song, which is how he knows the name of his father's consort: Faunehm. Heustienne asks you to accompany Orn Khai to the Fringes to learn more about the Slumbering Wyrm.",
        "The impatient young dragon rushes into the temple without you, and judging by his cries for help, he regrets having done so.",
        "Orn Khai's assailant bested, you resume your search for the dragon of legend. Just as the youthful Dravanian is wondering whether or not the creature you encountered was the Slumbering Wyrm itself, a rather scholarly looking gentleman appears.",
        "The gentleman turns out to be one Professor Erik, and he too has an interest in the legend of the Slumbering Wyrm. He goes on to give you a lecture on the subject─the only noteworthy part of which being that the Slumbering Wyrm was actually a high priest, who passed away over three hundred years prior. Orn Khai soon grows tired of Erik's musings and suggests you head to Coerthas to speak with Ser Alberic. ",
        "Ser Alberic apologizes for sending you on a wild goose chase of sorts, but is quick to note that he has another legend you may wish to explore. This one's roots lie far to the east, Ser Alberic remarking that Orn Khai may struggle to make the journey with you due to his modestly sized wings. Orn Khai is, however, undeterred and convinces Ser Alberic to come up with a way to allow him to make the crossing to Kugane.<br><br>※The next dragoon quest will be available from Ser Alberic upon reaching level 65."

He neglects to inform you of exactly how the young dragon will be making the journey, but ensures you that you will be able to rendezvous with him if you speak to Karaku, the owner of the Bokaisen Hot Springs.",

It is immediately evident that all is not as it seems when the contents of the crate start demanding to be set free. Orn Khai soon escapes from the confines of the box and informs you that the legend of the Serpent of the Ruby Sea is the tale you shall be investigating next. The two of you make your way to Isari in order to see just how much the locals know.",

However, as his knowledge does not stretch much beyond that, he bids you talk to one of the village's older inhabitants if you seek more information. You spy an elderly woman nearby and head in her direction to see if she cannot aid your search.",

According to her, the serpent is no mere faerie tale; it lurks nearby the Coral Banquet and has been to known to eat men whole. Undeterred, you elect to summon Orn Khai in order to share with him your findings.",
        "After hearing that the serpent commonly eats pirates whole, Orn Khai suggests there is little chance that the creature could be Faunehm. Nonetheless, his curiosity gets the better of him and he requests your assistance in searching for the beast of legend. Orn Khai heads off to hunt the bait required to lure the creature out of hiding, while you head for the Coral Banquet.",
        "Orn Khai hurls the freshly hunted bait into the sea and, lo and behold, a menacing creature rises from the ocean depths. You lock horns with the Serpent of the Ruby Sea.",

Putting the issue to one side, it is agreed that Orn Khai will remain in Kugane and search for further leads as to Faunehm's whereabouts.<br><br>※The next dragoon quest will be available from Orn Khai upon reaching level 68."

He also notes that he has made several new acquaintances of late thanks to Karaku. In fact, Orn Khai was just about to set off to meet one such friend when you arrived. Apparently said acquaintance knows something that might aid your search. You decide to accompany Orn Khai and find out what this individual has to say.",

He suggests that you travel to Reunion on the Azim Steppe, for an area nearby is said to be home to a slumbering dragon with scales as dark as the night sky. Orn Khai, convinced you may have finally found Faunehm, sets off for the Steppe and bids you follow him as soon as possible.",
        "You find Orn Khai in Reunion surrounded by Auri children whose curiosity has been piqued by the petite dragon. His hands more than full, Orn Khai encourages you to ask the adult members of the local community about the dragon you seek. You look upon the settlement and wonder whom to engage in conversation first.",
        "It soon becomes apparent that the people of Reunion are not much for small talk. One tells you in no uncertain terms to leave him be if you are not of mind to trade, and another refuses to talk at all. However, the Spinner smiles upon you eventually, as you hear that the dragon is said to dwell near the mountains north of Reunion.",
        "You return to Orn Khai to find him somewhat overwhelmed by all the children's affection. After sharing your findings with him, he agrees the two of you would be best served by searching around the nearby mountains. Once he has freed himself of his admirers, you both prepare to head to Ceol Aen to the northwest.",
        "While searching for Faunehm, you encounter an Oroniri warrior who states that the dark-scaled dragon has thrashed eight of his tribe's finest warriors. You soon find the creature and it is immediately apparent that this is the dragon you have been searching for. Orn Khai calls out to Faunehm, but she is in a frenzy of rage, and words do not reach her.",

However, as luck would have it, it is Orn Khai's despair that allows him to see the truth─Faunehm's current state is a result of having to bear centuries of solitude. Just as he happens upon this theory, the warrior you previously met informs you that some Qestiri merchants have hired a dragon hunter. You hurry with Orn Khai to get to Faunehm before the hunter can.",

        "Surito Carito reveals that his study of the invisible voidsent's corpse has yielded a quasi-cure capable of impeding the spread of the Nymian plague. A miraculous discovery though it may be, he goes on to say that the reason he summoned you is because one of his research assistants, Setoto, has vanished. Worried that harm will befall his friend should they wander too far, he asks that you find and escort the tonberry back. Alka believes there is a chance Setoto has been registered to the Hunt, and suggests you begin your search at the Maelstrom Command.",
        "The Hunt billmaster informs you that the only tonberry currently registered to the Hunt is one by the name of Marberry. Not too long after, R'ashaht appears bearing some interesting news. The Miqo'te commander tells you that Vesper Bay has been awash with rumors of an odd-looking stowaway who scurried off a ferry as it pulled ashore. Whoever─or whatever─it was, has been described as being small of stature like a Lalafell but with exotic features. Perhaps this mysterious passenger is your missing tonberry, and it would benefit you to investigate this matter further.",
        "You and Alka approach a sailor who looks to be a crew member of the boat R'ashaht mentioned. The man confirms having seen the stowaway, which he describes as some manner of rare beast of a gobbie without a mask. He assures you that whatever it was, the Brass Blades are looking for it. While Alka makes a detour to Ul'dah to see what more he can uncover though his contacts regarding this incident, he asks that you inform Surito Carito of all that has happened.",
        "Surito Carito is of the opinion that, if in Aldenard, Setoto will be near impossible to find. He believes it would be best to wait until you come across any additional news on where the missing tonberry might have gone before making a move. Rest while you can because as soon as word of Setoto's possible whereabouts reaches you and Alka Zolka, the two of you must rush to find, and possibly rescue, the tonberry.<br><br>※The next scholar quest will be available from Surito Carito upon reaching level 63."

        "According to Alka Zolka, the Brass Blades have managed to track down a creature resembling the description of the stowaway. Luckily for you, their quarry has slipped into the Black Shroud─an area that is outside of their jurisdiction. He then bids you to follow him to Camp Tranquil, where Setoto now likely is, and the two of you make ready to depart.",
        "Alka Zolka reminds you that while the stowaway─who may well be Setoto─is safe from the Brass Blades, the forested area is just as dangerous for a lone tonberry. With precious little time to waste, it is decided the two of you will split up to conduct separate searches. Alka will check the northern part of the Black Shroud, while you scour the south.",
        "You thoroughly investigate the area but you do not find Setoto. Mayhap it is time to move on and continue looking for the tonberry elsewhere.",

The pack of hunters are not at all pleased by your presence and warn you not to come any closer to them or their prey. Seeing as they intend to kill and skin the creature before them, it may be in your best interest to stop them.",
        "The poachers are no match for you, and you swiftly dispatch of all three of them. Setoto, on the other hand, did not seem to fare nearly as well as you in her fight against them. Quickly cast Adloquium on her that she might be healed.",
        "Shortly after casting Adloquium upon Setoto, you are joined by Alka Zolka, who is immediately enamored of the young tonberry girl. After commenting upon her beauty, he goes on to ask what motivated her to travel so far from her home in Bronze Lake. She tells you of how in the days before Nym's collapse her father was a scholar and Royal Marine. Suspecting he was captured by the Amdapori whilst on an undercover mission there, she sought to examine the ruins for anything that once belonged to him. Touched, Alka eagerly volunteers the both of you to aid her in her search. Return to Camp Tranquil with the tonberry girl and Alka to discuss how the three of you might proceed.",
        "Alka Zolka will be returning once to Bronze Lake to inform Surito Carito of all that has happened. Before going, however, he makes Setoto promise that she will no longer wander about on her own and asks that you see that she gets plenty of rest in his absence. Once he returns and Setoto is fully recovered, the three of you will be leaving to search Amdapor Keep for a memento of Setoto's father.<br><br>※The next scholar quest will be available from Alka Zolka upon reaching level 65."

If, as you have come to suspect, Setoto's father was captured by the Amdapori while on a mission to discover a way to reverse the Nymian plague, he would have been transported to Amdapor Keep for questioning. It is then likely that some of his remaining possessions can be found there. Make your way to the ancient ruins and look for any items which Setoto might remember her father by.",
        "The three of you pick your way through Amdapor Keep, and you encounter various denizens of the ruins and ancient artifacts─including an Amdapori journal which touches upon taking a Nymian spy captive. From it you are able to conclude that Setoto's father's personal effects have been stored in a mana idol. As you begin dismantling these Amdapori golems, you are confronted by a manasnatcher, one of the hulking creatures that resides there. After a hard-fought battle, it falls lifeless to the ground, and a coffer tumbles from its innards. You, Alka, and Setoto move to open it.",
        "You open it to see that it contains what appears to be Setoto's father's grimoire, clothes, and soul crystal. Gingerly taking the crystal in her hands, Setoto begs her father's faerie, Lilac, to appear. It unleashes a sphere of purple light and Setoto falls to the ground, unconscious. After an unsuccessful attempt to wake her, Alka Zolka bids you help him transport the tonberry out of the dangerous ruins and to Camp Tranquil.",
        "You and Alka return to Camp Tranquil with Setoto, and the marauder asks that you use your knowledge to diagnose what is wrong with her. You conclude that, despite the lack of physical injuries, it will be a while before the young tonberry girl wakes. Alka is deeply troubled by the news, and his panicked shouts draw the attention of Landenel of the Wood Wailers, who offers to take Setoto into his care until such a time she has recovered. Requesting that you remain behind with her and Landenel, Alka Zolka leaves you for Bronze Lake to speak with Surito Carito.<br><br>※The next scholar quest will be available from Alka Zolka upon reaching level 68."

Despite having been asleep for quite some time now, however, the tonberry girl shows no signs of improvement, and Alka grows worried that something else is wrong. He asks that you visit Surito Carito at the Wanderer's Palace that the two of you might combine your scholarly knowledge to determine what exactly is amiss.",
        "Surito Carito speculates that the reason Setoto has not recovered is because she managed only a partial summoning. He believes this has resulted in a phantom faerie, which has forestalled her recovery by preventing her aether from being returned to her. Telling you the only way for you to save her is to track down and dispatch of this half-formed creature, Surito Carito leaves you to return to Alka Zolka.",
        "As you are informing Alka Zolka of the current state of affairs, Landenel approaches you with interesting news. He tells you of how a large number of his men have encountered a ghost in the forest─one in the form of a floating purple orb. This description happens to match the partially summoned Lilac at the ruins, and you and Alka decide to investigate. According to Landenel, the Wailers have spotted the phantom faerie in Snakemolt and the Upper Paths. The ex-marauder will be searching Snakemolt, while you have a look around the Upper Paths.",
        "You carefully survey the first area in the Upper Paths for the roaming purple specter. You find nothing. Perhaps it is time to move on.",
        "A thorough search of the next region in the Upper Paths uncovers nothing. Hopefully the last stretch of the South Shroud you have been ordered to inspect will turn up something.",
        "As you scan this last bit of land, something purple and aetherial catches your eye. It releases a hideous shriek and lashes out at you. You quickly defeat it, but alas, it is not the phantom faerie you seek. Alka Zolka no doubt awaits you back at Camp Tranquil. It is best not to keep him waiting.",
        "Alka Zolka also has had no luck in locating the faerie. As the two of you prepare to open up discussions on how you might proceed, Landenel appears, once again. He tells you of how one of his men was just attacked by the phantom faerie, which then escaped into the Lost City of Amdapor. While eager to give chase, due to the darkness that lingers there, the commanding Wood Wailer must first receive permission from the Order of the Twin Adder before any of you can enter. Asking that you make preparations while you wait, he goes to speak with his higher-ups. <br><br>※The next scholar quest will be available from Alka Zolka upon reaching level 70."

        "Alka Zolka informs you that Landenel has officially been granted permission from the Order of the Twin Adder to enter the lost city. Asking that you accompany him to the gates, he then dashes off with you following not too far behind him.",
        "You wait for Landenel to arrive, and together, the three of you enter the portal. Almost immediately you spot the phantom faerie and give chase. Puzzled by its movements, Alka comments that the sphere of purple light seems as though it is attempting to guide you somewhere. It eventually fuses together with Kuribu─one of the guardian statues. After defeating the resulting amalgamation, you glance down to see a blood red gem gleaming upon the ground.",
        "Stooping down, you quickly pocket the red gem that fell from the Kuribu-faerie fusion. Turning back, Alka calls out to you, bidding that you hurry to follow him and Landenel back to Camp Tranquil. Everyone is eager to see if Setoto has finally opened her eyes.",
        "Upon your arrival to Camp Tranquil, Landenel disappears and returns shortly with Setoto in tow. Alka is relieved to see that she is finally awake. Setoto tells you briefly of a dream she saw of her father and it spurs Alka to once more question the half-manifested Lilac's intentions for entering the lost city and seemingly leading you to Kuribu. He then turns to you and inquires as to what you crouched down to retrieve right before leaving Amdapor. You hold out the gemstone and Alka, recognizing its possible value, requests that you to deliver it to Surito Carito for inspection.",
        "According to Surito Carito, the gemstone is the crystal core of the statue you defeated and contains potent white magic. He surmises that Lilac, a part of Setoto's father's consciousness, was driven by a strong desire to see Setoto cured of the Green Death. As such, the phantom faerie led you through the lost city that you might discover this gem, which may contain a remedy to the condition afflicting inhabitants of the Wanderer's Palace.",
        "Certain it holds the key to curing the Green Death and reviving the scholarly arts, Surito Carito vows to begin his analysis of the red gemstone straightaway. He thanks you, going on to say he stands by his choice in bequeathing Lily onto you. While Surito Carito seems to have said all he means to say, Alka Zolka is looking at you expectantly. It seems, he too, has a few words for you.",
        "Alka Zolka is over the moon to see that Setoto is back to normal, and is incredibly excited about what the future holds in store for the Royal Marines. Telling you he feels blessed to have you as a friend, he then suggests that together you return home and train.<br><br>※The next scholar quest will be available from Alka Zolka once you have met the following requirements:<br>※ FINAL FANTASY XIV: Shadowbringers must be registered to your service account.<br>※ You must have completed the main scenario quest “Shadowbringers.”<br>※ You must have completed the role quest “The Soul of Temperance.”"

        "Oboro has the look of a man who has seen better days.",
        "You find your old friend Oboro at something of a loss. News of his deeds on behalf of Princess Yuki have reached his village, revealing to the elders that he is hale, hearty, and entirely capable of making the journey home. Despite this, they do not seem particularly eager to welcome him back, a development which has the young shinobi feeling decidedly unappreciated. As Oboro laments his plight, he remembers that there is someone who requires his aid─Captain Jacke of the Rogues' Guild, who would investigate some shady Domans that have been stirring up trouble of late. Resolving to assist your friend and mentor in whatever way you can, you set out for Limsa.",
        "Jacke relates to you a curious tale. The Krakens captured a crew of self-styled Doman sailors in the eastern seas, who offered all the treasures in their cargo hold in exchange for amnesty and safe passage to Eorzea. No sooner had the ship dropped anchor, however, than the Easterners vanished into the dark of night, taking with them only an inconspicuous scroll. Petty theft though it may be, the code is the code, and Jacke would see the scroll returned and the men brought to justice. At the guildmaster's behest, you make for the Drowning Wench to see if I'tolwann knows aught of the men's whereabouts.",
        "As I'tolwann tells it, a group of boisterous Easterners visited the Wench not long before, shouting loudly and conspicuously about a profitable transaction they intend to make in Wineport. Jacke will doubtless be eager to hear the news.",
        "Jacke listens to your report with great interest. Though more than a bit leery of how openly the men discussed their shady dealings, a lead is a lead. You set out for Wineport with Oboro and Jacke, taking care to watch your back and with your eyes and ears open.",
        "Your arrival in Wineport is minutes too late─the men have already made off with a haul of wine, and were sighted heading for Bloodshore. Suspecting that it may not be meant for sale, but rather to slake a crew's thirst on a long ocean voyage, Jacke deduces that they intend to furtively sail back home with the ill-gotten scroll. Make for the south of Bloodshore and keep your eyes out for any suspicious Easterners.",
        "You come upon three Hingan swordsman enjoying some of Wineport's finest on the beach. Not taking kindly to the interruption, they immediately draw their blades. Though you are able to make short work of them, the scroll is nowhere to be found. Head north to rendezvous with Jacke and Oboro, with the hope that their search has proved more fruitful than your own.",
        "Jacke and Oboro are no worse for the wear after a similar scuffle with Hingan ruffians, but have gained no insight into the whereabouts of the scroll you seek. No sooner have you begun to ponder your next course of action when you are greeted by the sudden presence of the black marketeer from the House of Sticks, who─much to everyone's surprise─immediately reveals himself to be none other than Karasu Redbeak, Oboro's erstwhile friend and nemesis. As is his wont, Karasu speaks in riddles, cryptically alluding to a greater plot involving the scroll while offering precious little in the way of actual details─save that your true quarry sails for Kugane as you speak. Karasu disappears in a puff of smoke, and Oboro─clearly flustered─suggests that the three of you retreat to the nearby ninja hideout to discuss your next course of action in secret.",
        "At the dock storehouse, you and your two companions come up with a plan. Jacke will sail ahead to Hingashi, with Oboro accompanying as a guide. In the meantime, you will train and hone your skills as a ninja, that you may be ready to answer the call when they need you. Bidding them a safe journey, you resolve to take your mastery of ninjutsu to new levels, as there is no telling what dangers await you across the Ruby Sea.<br><br>※The next ninja quest will be available from Yomei upon reaching level 63."

It would appear that Oboro and Jacke have safely arrived on Hingan shores, and that their investigation into the stolen scroll has turned up some promising leads. Your shinobi friend and master bids you join him in Kugane to continue the search. After disembarking, seek out Oboro in the alley behind Pier #2.",
        "Oboro relates to you all that he and Jacke have learned. The theft of the scroll was apparently the work of the Garnet League, a band of masterless samurai who turned to banditry after having fled the battlefield in dishonor during the Doman uprising. Easily recognizable by their blood red garb and rough demeanor, they sojourn in Kugane of late. At Oboro's behest, spy upon them from the shadows of the Shiokaze Hostelry and the Rakuza District and see what knowledge you might glean of their plans, and of the scroll's current whereabouts.",
        "Eavesdropping upon the Garnet League men, you manage to learn that they were hired to retrieve the scroll from an imperial storehouse by a Hingan client whose identity is not immediately evident. You also succeed in gathering more information on the Garnet League itself─namely, that it is led by one Zakuro Brightblood, a samurai feared for both her prowess with the blade and her nigh-legendary temper. Oboro and Jacke will doubtless be keen to hear all you have learned.",
        "You and your companions share what you have learned, when you are joined by V'kebbe and Underfoot, who have been summoned to Kugane by Jacke to assist in the recovery of the scroll. Piecing together random bits of information, Captain Jacke devises a convoluted scheme to recover the scroll that will involve a high-wire act and imitation bird droppings, among other curious elements. With no better course of action coming immediately to mind, tasks are delegated amongst your party, and you prepare to move into action.",
        "You carry out Jacke's creative plan to perfection, and send Zakuro running to the baths in utter horror. Infiltrate the Bokairo, and search for the scroll in the changing baskets while a somewhat-unwilling Oboro and Jacke keep Zakuro occupied with their manly wiles.",
        "You search the baskets by the entrance to the baths, but the scroll is nowhere to be seen. Mayhap there is somewhere you haven't yet looked?",
        "You search another set of baskets, but to no avail. Wherever could Zakuro have hidden the scroll?",
        "You search the baskets in the innermost chamber of the bathhouse, where you successfully recover the scroll with Zakuro none the wiser. Make haste back to the alley and share the news of your success with your friends.",
        "Oboro and Jacke rejoice at the success of the mission. The shinobi's mood, however, darkens considerably upon seeing what the scroll actually is─a forbidden summoning mudra and ancient treasure of his village that went missing in the Garlean invasion of twenty-five years past. It would seem that the scroll slept untouched in an imperial vault until it was stolen by Zakuro and her minions at the behest of their mysterious client. As Oboro ponders who outside his village might have knowledge of the scroll, Karasu Redbeak appears in a puff of smoke, revealing that he was the one pulling the strings behind the operation on behalf of his new master, and threatening physical harm to Tsubame, V'kebbe, and Underfoot─who he has captured in the meantime─if you do not return the scroll to him. Issuing an enigmatic warning of some challenge to come, he disappears as quickly as he came, leaving you and your companions at an utter loss. Continue to hone your skill in the art of ninjutsu, that you may be ready for whatever deadly game the crow has in store for you.<br><br>※The next ninja quest will be available from Oboro upon reaching level 65."

        "Oboro glances impatiently about him, as if waiting for a tardy guest.",
        "Having heard no word from Karasu since you last spoke, Oboro informs you that he has sent for Princess Yuki of the Yatsurugi clan, in hopes of reinforcing the ranks before setting out to rescue your friends. Despite her most enthusiastic response, however, the spirited princess has yet to arrive. You and Jacke take to the streets of Kugane in hopes of finding the girl before she runs afoul of any unsavory types.",
        "You find Princess Yuki hidden in an alley, desperately trying to avoid the gaze of Akagi, her retainer-turned-bodyguard who has pursued her to Kugane with the intent of bringing her home to her people. At the princess's behest, spin a harmless lie to throw her man off the scent.",
        "You barely utter a few words when Akagi dashes off to board the next ship to Eorzea in search of the princess. Feeling somewhat guilty for taking advantage of the well-meaning but less-than-sharp-witted retainer, you console yourself with the knowledge that you have served the princess well.",
        "Though she regrets having asked you to tell a lie, Princess Yuki is grateful for your actions, for she can now repay both you and Oboro for your efforts on behalf of her and her kingdom. Eager to share what she has learned and begin the adventure, she dashes off to the piers to meet with Oboro as you follow in pursuit.",
        "Princess Yuki is sharing with you and Oboro her knowledge of Hingashi in hopes of identifying Karasu's mysterious employer, when your conversation is interrupted by the crow himself. He gleefully explains that he has prepared a “game” of sorts for you and your friends: you are to rescue your friends from the hideout of the Garnet League and claim the scroll as your prize, or fail and see your friends' lives forfeit. Having no choice but to submit to the eccentric shinobi's cruel and capricious demands, you and your friends set out for the Isle of Bekko.",
        "After a long and hard-fought battle on the Isle of Bekko, you have felled the fearsome Zakuro Brightblood and rescued your Underfoot and the Stray from the Garnet League's clutches. All that remains is free Tsubame and claim the scroll for emerging triumphant in Karasu's game.",
        "Karasu, never to be trusted, is all too quick to renege on his promise and demand the spoils despite your clear victory according to the very conditions he set. With his friend and fellow shinobi's life in the balance, Oboro tosses the scroll to a gloating Karasu, who unceremoniously shoves Tsubame in your general direction. Karasu's enigmatic master then arrives on the scene, and with a few dismissive words, seemingly roasts Karasu to a husk with a breath of fire before your very eyes. Claiming to be Hanzo of the Kagekakushi clan─the only true practitioners of the art of ninjutsu─he ominously states his desire to rid the world of the descendants of “Sasuke the Shamed,” as he dismissively refers to the legendary progenitor of the Doman shinobi. As Oboro stands stunned, Tsubame comforts him with a secret entrusted to her by one her elders─namely, that the scroll in Hanzo's hands is but one half of the forbidden summoning mudra he covets. As Underfoot and V'kebbe return home to Limsa, you set out for Yanxia with Oboro, Tsubame, and Jacke, to inform the elders of all you have seen and glean what wisdom you might before planning your next action.",
        "Upon arriving on the shores of Yanxia, you sojourn first in the fishing village of Namai. A clearly preoccupied Oboro states that he and Tsubame will make the trip from here to their village alone, as the elders may not take kindly to the presence of outsiders. The young shinobi promises you that they will return as soon as they are able, and you and Jacke resolve to keep your skills sharp in anticipation of the inevitable confrontation to come.<br><br>※The next ninja quest will be available from Jacke upon reaching level 68."

        "Oboro has returned from the village, but to hear Jacke tell it, the young shinobi is not quite himself. Suspecting that he might have wandered off to a nearby waterfall to clear his head─as is his wont─the two of you head off in pursuit.",
        "You and Jacke come upon Oboro under the falling waters of the Heron's Flight. As he dries himself off by the fire, the ninja shares with you just what has been troubling him so. As he tells it, he was given a hero's welcome upon his return to the village, but recent events have left him unable to accept the praise lavished upon him. Jacke comforts him with a tale of your own adventures, the moral of which is that when people give you more credit than you deserve, you might as well take it as an opportunity to better yourself rather than beating yourself up for your perceived failings. With newfound resolve, Oboro declares his intention to learn the secret history of Sasuke, his village's founder, from the old hermit known as Master Kamui. Return to Namai, where Tsubame has prepared a most majestic means of transportation for your journey.",
        "Oboro explains that Master Kamui has sequestered himself in meditation in Plum Spring, a short flight away from where you stand. When you are ready, mount the great falcon whose wings will carry you to your destination.",
        "Despite the troubles you took in seeking him out, Master Kamui is not keen to engage you in conversation, instead demanding that Oboro fetch him three ingredients to brew a medicine to cure his aching back. Though the old hermit seems quite comfortable in the company of Tsubame, it would appear you and your friends have little choice but to do his bidding.",
        "Back in Namai, you, Oboro, and Jacke resolve to split up and quickly dispense with the old hermit's busywork. Fetch a claw from the Doman weasels that prowl the Glittering Basin, while your friends see to the other items on Master Kamui's shopping list.",
        "After a hard-fought battle with the slavering beast, the weasel claw is yours. Return to Namai, and hope that your friends have found similar success in their hunts.",
        "You return to Namai, and are pleased to see that Oboro and Jacke have also managed to procure the rare ingredients sought by Master Kamui. Hoping that this will suffice to convince the old hermit to share his knowledge with you, you set out once again for Plum Spring on the wings of the great bird.",
        "You return to Plum Spring to find Master Kamui in fine fettle, some time in the company of the lovely Tsubame having clearly done the work of the most potent of elixirs. His spirits high, he regales you with the true story of Master Sasuke, he who brought ninjutsu to Doma and founded the village Oboro and his fellow shinobi call home. Long ago, Sasuke sailed across the Ruby Sea to Doma at the bidding of his master, Hanzo the First. Hanzo entrusted his young protégé with a scroll writ with the forbidden mudra of summoning he had devised, commanding him to use it to free the Doman people from tyranny. Sasuke did just that, and then─fearing the mudra's power─cleaved the scroll in two, that the fearsome knowledge contained within never again would see the light of day. At the same time, he founded a village, that he might train his new countrymen in the art of ninjutsu, and pass his legacy on to future generations. Sadly, as his mission─even at the time─was shrouded in the utmost of secrecy, Sasuke's heroic deeds on behalf of Doma never reached the ears of his clansmen, and centuries later, it would seem that the descendants of the Kagekakushi clan have come to see him as a traitor and deserter who stole away to a foreign land with his master's forbidden knowledge. As Oboro puts the pieces together, Princess Yuki and Jacke arrive bearing grave news. The Kagekakushi clan means to sail for Doma to claim what they believe is rightly theirs─and when they come, they will come with an army.",
        "With clouds of war brewing on the horizon, you return to Namai with Oboro, knowing that it is but a matter of time before Hanzo and the Kagekakushi army arrives on Doman shores. You resolve to devote all your efforts to your training, knowing that you and your friends will be tested as never before.<br><br>※The next ninja quest will be available from Oboro upon reaching level 70."

        "The army of the Kagekakushi clan comes, and they come in great numbers. Oboro would meet the advancing army with his fellow shinobi, but he has one grave concern─Lord Hanzo himself is nowhere to be seen. You suggest that perhaps the man means to sneak into Yanxia through the back door─that is to say, by way of the Azim Steppe. Finding your theory a convincing one, Oboro bids you guard the passage while he leads the rest of the shinobi against Lord Hanzo's imposing army.",
        "As you keep watch by the passage to Yanxia on the edge of the Azim Steppe, an old man approaches. Though it appears at a glance to be Master Kamui, the old hermit of Plum Spring, it is quickly revealed to be little more than one of Hanzo's disguises. The Kagekakushi lord gloatingly explains that he used his superior ninjutsu to create the illusion of a false army, luring the most capable shinobi out of the village, then snuck in with his flawless disguise and stole away with the scroll with the utmost of ease. Eager to put to use the legendary power he has obtained, he forms the forbidden mudra of summoning─only to be surrounded by a nest of hopping rabbits. As Hanzo fumes with rage, a very-much-alive Karasu appears on a ledge above, revealing that it was in fact he who was pulling Hanzo's strings all along─the Karasu thought slain at Bekko was but a mirror, and the scroll in Hanzo's hands a cleverly disguised fake. With a sneer, Hanzo turns to face you, still believing his own form of ninjutsu to be superior to the Doman offshoot, but is proven wrong when he falls at the hands of you and Karasu. Looking out over the battlefield, you turn to the eccentric ninja who has again proven himself an unexpected friend.",
        "Karasu offers some rare words of praise for your skill at ninjutsu before walking off to wherever the wind will carry him. No sooner has he left than you are joined by Oboro and the rest of your companions, who joyfully report their triumph over the Kagekakushi clan. Oboro rejoices at the return of the scroll to the village, but soon realizes that Karasu has made off with the true other half. Jacke claims the fake scroll and sets off for Limsa with proof that his job is done, and Princess Yuki─heartened to have repaid her debt to you and Oboro─likewise runs off to Eorzea in search of her hapless retainer Akagi. Oboro expresses his intent to go after Karasu, and asks Tsubame to concoct another tale to explain his absence to the village elders. After a round of farewells has been exchanged, Oboro bids you visit him at his hideout upon your return to Eorzea, where he would share with you a final word.",
        "Back at the storehouse in La Noscea, Oboro shares with you his recent thoughts on his path as a shinobi. Though his mind thus far has often been clouded with doubts, his reflection on the story of Master Sasuke and the origins of his village has given him clarity. He would follow in the footsteps of his honorable forebear, walking the path he believes in even if it means setting aside his commitments to his homeland in favor of listening to his own heart. With a newfound sense of purpose, he resolves to pursue Karasu and the missing scroll. Thanking you one last time for your friendship and your commitment to the path of the shinobi, he bids you farewell for the day, expressing his wish that your next adventure together will come someday soon.<br><br>※The next ninja quest will be available from Oboro once you have met the following requirements:<br>※ FINAL FANTASY XIV: Shadowbringers must be registered to your service account.<br>※ You must have completed the main scenario quest “Shadowbringers.”<br>※ You must have completed the role quest “Courage Born of Fear.”"

The stage is set for Scorpion Crossing in western Thanalan, and you set out to join Aldis there.",

To simply confront you, it would seem, is enough to convince him that he is no match for you, and he abruptly abandons the duel and excuses himself. His uncharacteristic behavior leaves Mylla at a loss for words, and she turns her steps back to the Gladiators' Guild, more confounded than when she left.",

Having thought long and hard on the reason for your strength, he has finally come to realize that which is dearest to him: the Gladiators' Guild. To that end, Aldis declares that he will give up the itinerant life and henceforth remain in Ul'dah to watch over the guild. Though Mylla appears none too impressed by his presumptuousness, you know that, deep down, she is glad for his presence. Thus do you take your leave, assured in the knowledge that all will be well in the end."

        "You do not find Widargelt in Ala Gannha, but it appears he comes often to train the villagers. According to one, the monk had business in Little Ala Mhigo, and you strike out for Thanalan in pursuit.",
        "You arrive in Little Ala Mhigo to find Widargelt standing before a grave─that of Adri, his closest friend turned foe. No sooner do you warn your brother monk that the Resistance is trying to find him than a soldier arrives. Revealed to be a member of Widargelt's old unit, the man invites his former captain to a meeting at Rhalgr's Reach. Widargelt accepts, and asks that you be present for the proceedings.",
        "The meeting proves to be with none other than Lyse. In order to build a unified nation, she requests Widargelt's cooperation as a man of royal blood, but he declines, stating that he wishes to serve Ala Mhigo as a humble monk. Respecting his decision, Lyse instead asks Widargelt to train Resistance soldiers in the way of Fist of Rhalgr, and he happily agrees. At Widargelt's behest, the three of you then pay a visit to the Temple of the Fist. There, Lyse and Widargelt affirm that, though their paths may differ, their goals are one and the same. Satisfied that all is well, you set out back to Ul'dah, where Erik awaits.",
        "Erik is pleased to learn that Widargelt's quest to revive the Fist of Rhalgr is proceeding apace. Thanking you for laying his fears to rest, he declares his intent to observe Widargelt and Lyse as they continue striving towards their goals."

        "Curious Gorge is training here, but his mind is elsewhere.",
        "Curious Gorge has been training as hard as ever and has indeed grown stronger for it, yet upon seeing you for the first time in an age, he immediately recognizes that you have grown stronger still. After you regale him with tales of your adventures in the First, particularly those of Granson and Dikaiosyne, he concludes that the reason for his limited growth is love─or rather, that he has been unable to put it out of his mind. Curious Gorge has sent many missives to Dorgono in the Far East, but has yet to receive even a single reply, and so he resolves to go and see her in person...and thus is not present when Dorgono and her father Luvsan arrive moments later, having recently come all the way from the Azim Steppe to thank in person all those who aided the Qerel. Since Curious Gorge is nowhere to be found, you are to proceed to the Moraby Drydocks where Broken Mountain and his warriors can be found.",
        "During the course of their conversation, Broken Mountain admits to Luvsan that he does not carry an axe because he can no longer fight. However, the elder Xaela does not believe all hope is lost, and proposes a treatment that may restore him to fighting condition. A certain type of moss will be necessary for this, and Luvsan believes he saw a suitable substitute on the way to the docks.",
        "The moss in question can be found growing on boulders strewn throughout the general vicinity, and Luvsan bids you gather it by first shattering them with a Heavy Swing, which should render it easier to collect. If nothing else, it is inarguably a more dramatic way of gathering moss than gently scraping it off.",
        "You succeed in gathering the moss in the distinct warrior fashion. Luvsan should be satisfied with the quantity in your possession.",
        "Taking advantage of your privacy, Luvsan confesses that he had an ulterior motive for coming to Eorzea: to confirm his suspicions that his daughter had fallen in love with a warrior of the West. After meeting you, he concludes that you are the suitor in question, and offers to bless your union─at which point Dorgono returns and puts an end to the discussion for the time being.",
        "With all gathered for the ritual, Luvsan offers an elixir to Broken Mountain, who drinks deep. Finally, he instructs you to strike the injured warrior with all your might, assuring you both that it is the only way. Though Broken Mountain is understandably uncomfortable with this proposal, the die is cast, and only a Heavy Swing will suffice.",
        "Broken Mountain weathers your assault, and moments later finds himself filled with newfound strength. He is a warrior reborn, and the beast within is his to command. As all celebrate his successful recovery, Curious Gorge approaches─but observing from afar, mistakes Dorgono's joyful smile as an expression of her love towards you, leading him to succumb to his inner beast and charge. Fortunately, before it turns into a needlessly messy and violent affair, she brings him to his senses with a single blow.<br><br>After Curious Gorge recovers, he apologizes for the misunderstanding, and joins in celebrating his brother's miraculous recovery. Sensing that this is the Western suitor, Luvsan silently approves, and declares that it is time to return to the Steppe─alone. Dorgono, however, is to remain in Eorzea, where she will continue to hone her skills until she is a warrior fit to be wed. Needless to say, both she and Curious Gorge are more than satisfied with this state of affairs, and together they return to Hidden Falls to begin their training together.",
        "Curious Gorge reminds you not to grow complacent in your own efforts to grow stronger still, for with Broken Mountain healed and Dorgono in Eorzea for the time being, your competition for the title of the realm's greatest warrior has grown that much more intense. And indeed, the day may come when one of the three will dethrone you...but not yet."

        "Alberic is keen to hear of your adventures.",

Upon mention of Orn Khai, the young dragon himself appears, joining the conversation and listening eagerly as you regale him with your adventures in the First. Your account of Andreia's demise brings to mind the tale of Nidhogg, as he too was driven only by memories of a time long since passed. Orn Khai expresses his profound sorrow that no one would mourn the passing of the mighty wyrm, and suggests consulting Faunehm to learn more of the fallen Nidhogg.",
        "Faunehm answers Orn Khai's call and gladly shares her memories of her sire, Nidhogg. You learn that King Thordan had invited Ratatoskr to speak on behalf of all dragons. When he asked her to recount Nidhogg's views on mankind, she stated her beloved's thoughts on the matter, in particular that their mortal frailty made them unfit for the role of Hydaelyn's guardian. Upon hearing these words, Thordan was filled with rage and slaughtered Ratatoskr, which drove Nidhogg into madness and sparked the Dragonsong War. After concluding her account of these historic events, Faunehm advises that you commemorate him by offering a flower for which he had a particular affinity, the mist lily, at the site of his passing. Orn Khai believes that they can be found growing in Ohl Tahn and wastes not a moment in flying off to gather the elusive bloom.",
        "The flowers you seek grow in the most unlikely of places, peeking out between the cracks of a stark rocky outcrop. Orn Khai will be pleased to hear that the search is over.",
        "Orn Khai is delighted that you were able to find the mist lilies and is eager to offer them in memorial of Nidhogg. Since his eyes were used to summon Shinryu, which you defeated in Gyr Abania, this could be considered his final resting place.",
        "You and Orn Khai arrive at the Royal Menagerie to pay your respects to Nidhogg. As you reflect on past encounters with the wyrm, your mind is cast back to the days spent as an Azure Dragoon, fighting alongside Estinien. Satisfied that the memory of the wyrm's memory has been honored, Orn Khai asks that you share Faunehm's tale with Alberic.",
        "Back at the Observatorium, Alberic is intrigued to hear such a detailed account of King Thordan's betrayal. He plans to impart this newly revealed information to the Temple Knights, as he is a firm believer that matters of historical accuracy are of the utmost importance in building peaceful relations between man and dragon. Though the road ahead will not be an easy one, your friendship with Orn Khai will serve as a shining example that trust and cooperation are possible between your races, and that even former enemies need not be beholden to the past."

        "After expressing his delight at seeing you again, Sanson informs you that he and his unit also took to battle at the Ghimlyt Dark. However, the relatively inexperienced bards struggled with their songs when they were hard-pressed. With Guydelot unwilling to instruct his juniors, Jehantel suggests that the two of you put on a performance for them, that they might experience a song brimming with heart. It is decided that Guydelot will also take part, and you set out to find him in Nine Ivies in the East Shroud.",
        "According to Pukno Poki, Guydelot has ventured deep into the woods. Believing that the willful bard is most likely to respond to you, Jehantel bids you call out to him. With the chat mode in <span class=\"highlight\">Say</span>, enter “Guydelot” to yell out to your comrade at the designated location in Nine Ivies.",
        "You yell out Guydelot's name at the top of your lungs, but the only response is silence. Perhaps you should try again deeper in the woods. With the chat mode in <span class=\"highlight\">Say</span>, enter “Guydelot” to yell out to your comrade at the designated location in Nine Ivies.",
        "At last, Guydelot reveals himself, and you inform him of the performance. The bard agrees on account of the rare opportunity to perform with you, and the stage is set for the Sea of Clouds. Sanson instructs you to gather at the airship landing in Gridania while he seeks his superiors' permission to use a vessel.",
        "With the airship secured, your party sets out for the Sea of Clouds, to the place where your journey for the Ballad of Oblivion reached its end. With the heavens as your backdrop, you give a heartfelt performance of a piece written by Jehantel and inspired by your own adventures. The song moves your small audience nigh to tears, helping the recruits to understand that which is most important to a bard. Its lesson also moves Sanson to try to better understand Guydelot, and he convinces his friend to guide his juniors in his own time.",
        "Back at the airship landing, Sanson reiterates his desire to help his men become the best bards they can be, before running off in pursuit of the ever free-spirited Guydelot. This leaves you alone with Jehantel, who thanks you for the sublime experience of performing with you. The song, born of your collaboration, woke memories of the passion he had in his youth. And generations hence, your erstwhile mentor believes, it will still be sung, awakening passion in countless more souls."

        "Your sudden visit comes as a surprise to Alaqa, who confides that she feels ill at ease with both the art of conjury and her place in the Conjurers' Guild. Fortunately, Sylphie and Gatty soon arrive to lighten the mood and, seemingly inspired by your adventurous tale, suggest a course of action─it seems a training trip to the Hedgetree is in order.",
        "You catch up with Sylphie in the Central Shroud, only to find that some dastardly Ixali plot has riled up the elementals. Drained by her battle with an enraged treant, Sylphie begs you to hurry to the Hedgetree, where Gatty is attempting to soothe the forest spirits' wrath alone...",
        "Finding Gatty battered and exhausted by the elementals' anger, you step in to calm them with your own tranquil energies. While you are thus occupied, it falls to Alaqa to overcome her doubts and perform a healing spell for her suffering Padjali friend. Overjoyed by Alaqa's breakthrough, Sylphie and Gatty rush back to report to Brother E–Sumi, while Alaqa herself lingers behind.",
        "Alaqa seems strengthened by the experience, and determined to continue her studies at Stillglade Fane. Somewhat embarrassed by the sudden onslaught of emotions, she asks that you pass on word of her decision to Raya–O in her stead.",
        "Raya–O listens to your report with keen interest, expressing her pleasure at both Alaqa's progress and the inspiration you provided. With friends such as Sylphie and Gatty at her side, Alaqa's future in the Conjurers' Guild seems destined to be a bright one. As for your mastery of the white, Raya–O warns against complacency, expecting to hear ever greater things from you ere your paths cross again..."

        "Lalai is eager to hear tell of your recent adventures.",
        "Lalai is most intrigued by your tales of your journey to and from the First. In return, she shares the news that she has at long last completed her written record of all the knowledge of black magic she has gathered in the course of your adventures together. However, now she faces a dilemma, as despite her pleas, the Order of Nald'thal adamantly refuses to house such potentially dangerous knowledge within their archives. At Lalai's behest─and that of the Hearer Zhai'a Nelhah, who once again has invited himself to join in your adventures─you resolve to accompany your friend to the Arrzaneth Ossuary.",
        "Upon arriving at the Ossuary, Lalai pleads her case to Prelate Yayake, but her words fall on deaf ears. When you step in to offer your support, the receptionist grudgingly admits that there is one member of the guild who sympathizes with the black mage's argument─and it is none other than Cocobuki, eldest of the five guildmasters. Heartened by the news, Lalai sets off to speak directly with the man himself, in hopes of winning his approval.",
        "Though Guildmaster Cocobuki shares Lalai's perspective regarding the value of her research, he explains that his word alone will not suffice to sway the naysayers. Instead, he proposes that a hearing be held with Prioress Dewlala herself, that the head of the Order of Nald'thal might hear both sides of the argument and render her impartial judgment. Lalai is quick to accept the challenge, and wishes to meet with you outside the Ossuary to work out the details of your argument.",
        "You have barely begun to discuss your argument when Lalai is struck with a bout of dizziness and suddenly collapses. Clearly shaken by the sight, Zhai'a Nelhah swoops the black mage into his arms and rushes off for Frondale's Phrontistery, where he would treat her further.",
        "Puzzling out the details with the help of knowledge you gleaned from your travels to the First, Zhai'a Nelhah believes he has found a way to restore Lalai's aetheric balance and save her from a grim fate. In return, the Hearer asks that you delay the proceedings with Prioress Dewlala by petitioning Master Cocobuki, but his request is cut short when Lalai arrives to insist the hearing go ahead as planned. She entrusts her magnum opus to you and promises to be along shortly. Taking the tomes that are the fruit of Lalai's labors in hand, you set off back for the Ossuary, where your allies and opponents in this cause await.",
        "You are doing your best to keep Dewlala's interest piqued when you are rejoined by Lalai, whose aetherial balance has been restored. Thoroughly won over by the black mage's logical and impassioned plea, the Prioress does not merely agree to housing her compendia in the Order's archives, but orders that a new research group dedicated to studying potential applications of black magic be established under Cocobuki's stewardship. Take your leave of this place with your companions, and revel in your hard-earned victory over prescripts and prejudice.",
        "Cocobuki congratulates Lalai on her success, while also warning her that the true battle to regain people's trust in the art of black magic has only just begun. Lalai restates her vow to work tirelessly toward her life's goal of handing down the art of black magic to future generations, before taking her leave to convey the good tidings to a certain Hearer who also played a role in your triumph.",
        "Zhai'a Nelhah is overjoyed to hear the good tidings, and positively stupefied when Lalai proceeds to offer him genuine words of thanks. The Hearer takes his leave in his typically oblivious and insensitive fashion, upon which Lalai once again thanks you for your efforts on her behalf. Relieved that she need no longer carry on her life's work in the shadows, she asks for your continued support in preserving the art of black magic for posterity."

        "Alka Zolka appears to be on the point of setting out somewhere.",
        "You speak with Alka Zolka, who is pleased to see you again. He invites you to join him at a training session in upper La Noscea, where he will be meeting Surito Carito─and you agree, as one can never know too many martial tactics.",
        "You and Alka Zolka locate Surito Carito near the Wanderer's Palace, where you are shortly joined by Setoto. The plan to train in Nymian mariner stratagems is soon left by the wayside, however, once you relate your experiences in the First. The story of how Lamitt cured stoneblight, in particular, catches Surito Carito's attention, and he exclaims that he may have an idea by which the same principles might be applied in the curing of the Nymian plague. It would not do to neglect any possible avenues that may lead to such a cure, of course, so the remaining three of you readily sign on to test his theory.",
        "You travel to the South Shroud and obtain the root that Surito Carito assigned you to procure with little trouble. As your errand took you farthest from upper La Noscea, it would be reasonable to expect that the others will have completed their own portions of the preparation ere you return.",
        "Alas, you are not the last to arrive back at the Wanderer's Palace─Alka Zolka, it transpires, was delayed by another run-in with a certain infamous goldsmith. Though all of the necessary materials are now assembled, there remains one more step to be taken: the testing of the experimental compound. Surito Carito hypothesizes that, in the unlikely event that he has miscalculated, consuming the concoction could result in an irreversible transformation into a mindless monster. Given the severity of the danger, he volunteers himself as test subject; however, Setoto points out that without him, the rest of the tonberries have little hope of finding a cure. She suggests that the compound be tested on her instead, but Alka Zolka is entirely unwilling to entertain the idea. Both become increasingly agitated, Setoto at last stalking off to spend time alone with her thoughts.",
        "You speak with Alka Zolka, who seems genuinely not to understand why Setoto does not appreciate his objections to her plan. After sending him off to cool his head, Surito Carito privately shares with you that he is concerned that Setoto's willingness to volunteer herself as test subject stems more from her love for Alka Zolka and desire to be a normal girl than it does from the logic she presented. He begs you seek her out and determine whether she has truly thought her choice through.",
        "When you confront Setoto, she admits to being in love with Alka Zolka, but maintains that this is not her primary reason for putting herself forth to test the cure. Rather, her experiences have imparted a keen awareness of the suffering that the tonberries are ever plagued by, and she is determined to help her countrymen─something that she is uniquely physiologically suited to do, as one of the youngest and last to have been afflicted with the disease.",
        "Back at the Wanderer's Palace, Setoto reiterates her commitment to undergoing the experiment. This time, Surito Carito is convinced by her logic, and Alka Zolka by her heartfelt words. Thus, the test begins, Setoto drinking the concoction to destabilize her own aether, Alka Zolka holding the Amdapori focus aloft, and you and your faerie channeling as much restorative aether as you can manage together. Though the experience appears to be excruciating, Setoto bears the pain, and in the end stands before you a Lalafell, with nary a trace of green to be seen.",
        "You speak with Alka Zolka, who is delighted that the cure was successful. He rambles about how admirable Surito Carito, you, and especially Setoto are before rushing off to continue his training, apparently seized with inspiration.",
        "Setoto comments on Alka Zolka's abrupt departure with fondness, and affirms to you that she will find a way to convey her feelings to him someday, though she is in no hurry to do so. At last, she has a real future ahead of her─with ample time to live, to love, and to pursue her dreams of becoming a scholar.",
        "Surito Carito, too, is pleased with the experiment's success. He vows to continue his research, and is confident that, in due course, he will be able to cure many more victims of the Nymian plague with the same methods tested on Setoto. Perhaps on some morn not far in the future, the sun will rise to see all tonberries restored to their former selves..."

        "Oboro is wearing a shite-eating grin on his face for reasons you can only begin to imagine.",
        "You reunite with Oboro, who cheerfully proclaims that he has at long last devised a plan to get the better of his longtime rival, Karasu Redbeak, and recover the half of the forbidden mudra scroll currently in the flamboyant ninja's possession. Splitting up so as not to attract attention, you make for the Hermit's Hovel─a bathhouse where Karasu has recently taken up residence─where Oboro means to elaborate on the details of his plan.",
        "Upon your arrival, Oboro eagerly explains how he intends to thwart his rival. Oboro intends to distract Karasu in the midst of his daily bathing ritual, allowing you to sneak into the bathhouse and make off with the scroll─a strategy not unlike the one you employed on a previous adventure back in Kugane. Wait in the shadows at Oboro's instruction, and be prepared to make your move when Karasu has been lured away from the scene.",
        "Oboro's ruse is a great success, as Karasu is all too willing to join him in a leisurely chat over some Hingan rice wine, leaving the bathhouse entirely unattended. Infiltrate the structure and sort through Karasu's belongings in search of the scroll before the wily ninja wises up to the situation and returns.",
        "You succeed in finding the scroll alongside other considerably less helpful documents also scattered throughout the hovel. Make a discreet retreat and return to the Long Climb that you might rendezvous with Oboro and ascertain that what you found is indeed the authentic item.",
        "Oboro rejoices upon seeing the scroll in your possession and declares the entire operation an unqualified triumph. He invites you to return to the dock storehouse that you might discuss matters further in private, and goes off on his way.",
        "As Oboro revels in his triumph over his bitter rival, the two of you are joined by your mutual friend Captain Jacke of the Dutiful Sisters. Heartened by the unexpected reunion, the jovial rogue invites the both of you for celebratory dinner and drinks at the Bismarck, an offer which Oboro accepts gladly. Make your way to Limsa Lominsa, where you might share a fine feast with your companions.",
        "At the Bismarck, your revelry is interrupted when Oboro rushes into the establishment half-naked. You and Captain Jacke quickly deduce that the “Oboro” whom you reunited with after the operation was none other than Karasu in disguise, a suspicion which is quickly confirmed when the savvy ninja reveals his true identity. The crow, victorious again over his erstwhile friend, offers a few mocking words, then turns into a bat and flaps away, leaving Oboro dejected and stark naked in the middle on the tavern floor. Jacke offers a few words of sympathy, and invites all of you back to the Sisters that you might find the poor man some clothes.",
        "You arrive at the Sisters to find Oboro decked out in clothes from Captain Jacke's personal wardrobe, a particularly garish outfit to which the fashion-challenged ninja has inexplicably taken a liking. He fills you in on the particulars of his inglorious defeat at Karasu's hands, resolving in the end to get his revenge on his rival. After Oboro takes his leave, Captain Jacke encourages you not to be a stranger in La Noscea, as both he and your ninja friends will like as not have need of your services again."

        "No sooner do you arrive at the Resistance camp than you find yourself face-to-face with Bajsaljen, leader of the Bozjan Resistance. He and his comrades explain to you their plan─to reforge the legendary weapons of Gunnhildr's Blades. Despite the scarcity of recordings relating to Queen Gunnhildr and her guard, they have made great strides in reproducing their vaunted arms. The key to their completion is a holy inscription engraved upon them, any traces of which were lost when Bozja Citadel fell many years ago. For their plans to move forward, they have enlisted the aid of an old friend─Mikoto.",
        "In perhaps a few too many words, and a demonstration assisted by Gerolt, Mikoto expounds further on their plans. Borrowing the long-forgotten techniques of Bozjan seers, you must use a special crystal focus to enter the memories of those who may have seen the holy inscription required to reforge Gunnhildr's weapons. The problem, however, is that anyone who had glimpsed the inscription perished when Bozja Citadel was destroyed. Or so they thought. While contemplating the possibility of survivors, Mikoto is struck by a vision of the future. In it, she sees Cid Garlond, convincing her that he is the eyewitness you are searching for.",
        "While strangely reluctant, Bajsaljen understands that Cid Garlond is likely your only hope of forging Gunnhildr's weapons. And so he bids you go to Rhalgr's Reach and speak with the Ironworks engineers there to find him.",
        "Speaking with a fledgling engineer in Rhalgr's Reach, it seems as though Cid is too preoccupied to help. Thankfully, Jessie happens to overhear your conversation and clears up any misconceptions regarding his present commitments. Before taking her leave, Jessie asks that you proceed with caution, fearful of what horrors may be unearthed from Cid's past.",
        "Arrangements have been made for Cid to meet you at the Doman Enclave. As you make your way to meet him, you cannot help but wonder what secrets his memories may hold."

Though apprehensive of what awaits him at Gangos, Cid reaffirms his commitment to helping the Bozjan Resistance. Together you board the airship which bears the two of you to Gangos.",

Realizing Lord Varis had no reason to be present at the citadel, he strains to remember who was the source of this anguished memory. In an instant his mind becomes clear, and the visage of Lord Varis is replaced by the man who shot him so many years ago─his own father, Midas nan Garlond. What's more, a closer inspection reveals he is in fact a thrall of the dreadwyrm Bahamut. With the mystery of Cid's past brought to light, you return to the waking world with the inscriptions of the blades of Gunnhildr, as well as an onerous truth.",

Much to his dismay, the one best suited to acquiring this for you is none other than Rowena.

The remaining members have already taken to the field, laboring to advance the front line toward the castrum. Having thus explained the situation, it occurs to Bajsaljen that you have yet to see the fortress with your own eyes. Seeking to rectify this, he invites you to look out over the battlefield and behold the object of their struggles.",

The problem, however, is the means to do so requires infiltrating imperial territory. Nevertheless, plans to restore the crystal focus are well underway. Plans that will require your assistance to succeed.",

Bajsaljen is ready to lead Gunnhildr's Blades into the belly of the beast, and he can think of no better soldier than you to accompany them.<br><br>※Players may enter Castrum Lacus Litore via the associated critical engagement.",
        "Your defeat of the imperial soldiers is almost effortless. Before you can plot your next move, however, Misija appears before you with Mikoto, as well as the crystal focus and the legendary blade Save the Queen. Using Mikoto as leverage, Misija coerces you into activating the crystal focus to explore the memories of the holy blade. Her intent is soon made clear when, moments later, Queen Gunnhildr emerges as a primal-like entity, enslaving the minds of the soldiers bearing the title of her guard. The threat of the queen proved too great, forcing the Resistance to retreat from the castrum.",
        "After regrouping at Utya's Aegis, you discuss the events that took place in the castrum. Mikoto explains that Misija discovered a way to alter the memories of Save the Queen, thereby allowing her to call forth Queen Gunnhildr in a fashion not unlike primal summoning. Having now lost both the castrum and Gunnhildr's Blades, the Resistance must think long and hard on how next to proceed.",
        "The Resistance suffered a grave defeat at Castrum Lacus Litore, but they are not discouraged. Marsak informs you that reinforcements from Dalmasca have recently arrived, with more en route from the Eastern alliance. Though it will take time, the Resistance will not rest until Bozja is free from imperial rule."

Zlatan can only look on in wonder at Gerolt's work, but their revelry comes to an end when Rowena appears. She explains that the idea to use memories to enhance the Resistance weapons was hers. What's more, one of the materials needed to accomplish this─a rather expensive one, she claims─was purchased from her stores on the behalf of the Resistance.

        "A report from Bwagi reveals the imperial legion's strength is not what it seems. In fact, they are now starved for resources, which has prompted allied forces from Dalmasca and Nagxia to launch an assault and thus slow the arrival of reinforcements to Bozja. The meeting is soon interrupted when a fatigued soldier enters, warning of yet another sighting of Queen Gunnhildr. For reasons as yet unknown, this prompts Mikoto to run off, likely to the southern front.",
        "What Mikoto expects to find on the battlefield remains to be seen, but the others bid you go and find her, fearful she may discover more than she hopes for.",
        "You find Mikoto unharmed, spying on Misija and a group of imperials. Once again, the vision of Queen Gunnhildr appears, though her power is noticeably diminished from your previous encounter. As you turn to leave, Mikoto's gift of the Echo offers an insight into the future─she sees the Resistance cornering Misija, who is unable to wield the power of Save the Queen. Mikoto would waste no time in relaying this news to the Resistance.",
        "Mikoto is convinced the apparition Misija has used to drive back Resistance forces is born of the memories of the late Queen Gunnhildr. She goes on to explain the fabled blade Save the Queen was likely designed to function in a similar fashion to the auracite you encountered in Rabanastre. Assuming this is true, Misija's plans cannot come to fruition without a substantial cache of crystals, meaning there may yet be time for the Resistance to strike back."

Marsak readies their soldiers and sets out for ruins on the eastern edge of the southern front in the hopes of catching Misija unawares.",
        "Events play out exactly as Mikoto foresaw. The Resistance manages to corner Misija who is unable to summon Queen Gunnhildr to battle. What Mikoto failed to see, however, is that this was all according to Misija's plan, for she too can now peer into the future. Imperial enforcements soon arrive, and a terrible battle ensues there in the ruins.",
        "No sooner do you bring low Misija's imperial soldiers than more arrive to take their place. But your battle was only meant to stall for time, as they manage to open a door leading deeper into the ruins, prompting Misija and Gunnhildr's Blades to escape into the shadows. You follow her into the heart of Delubrum Reginae, where you hope to put an end to her schemes and retrieve Save the Queen. ",
        "Deep within the heart of the ruins, Misija at last finds what she was searching for─a massive crystal rife with the aether needed to summon the full might of Save the Queen. Yet for all its power, the ancient blade proves no match for you. With the day won at last, you take the now-dormant Bozjan relic and an unconscious Misija back to Gangos.",
        "Misija has been placed in solitary confinement awaiting trial, and Bajsaljen believes it best if Save the Queen remain in Mikoto's care for the time being. But there will be no reprieve to study its inner workings, for an imperial warship can be seen approaching in the distance. Bajsaljen orders everyone to withdraw to Gangos and prepare to make a stand.",
        "When the Resistance next steps onto the battlefield, they will be joined by their allies from the Far East. Considering all that is at stake, there is no question that your strength will be needed when that day comes."

It seems the lieutenant is currently on leave and taking his ease at the Carline Canopy...if you have a moment or two to spare.",

Arenvald, the more approachable of the pair, is to be found in Rhalgr's Reach.",

The ensuing exchange reveals much about the young warriors and the motivations which drive them, but the ever-bitter Fordola soon bids you leave her be. Relenting to her wishes, you and Arenvald withdraw outside to the streets of the Ala Mhigan Quarter.",

However, the means to analyze the aetherial properties of these memories yet eludes him. Enter Regana, accompanied by an Allagan node commissioned from Garlond Ironworks designed to do precisely that. Though daunted by the potential ramifications of accepting further help─financial or otherwise─Zlatan can see no other way to proceed with Gerolt's plan. As Regana explains, the node will use gathered memories to create a registry with which you can modify the Resistance weapon as you see fit. Hoping for an adequate sample size, Gerolt suggests searching for two types of memories, eighteen of each.<br><br>※Memories of the dying can be found from certain FATEs and alliance raids.<br>※Haunting memories of the dying can be found from FATEs in the Gyr Abania region, or the Shadow of Mhach alliance raids.<br>※Vexatious memories of the dying can be found from FATEs in the Far East region, or the Return to Ivalice alliance raids.",
        "You return to Gangos with an ample supply of memories for the node, which wastes no time in analyzing and allocating them. When you offer up your Resistance weapon, however, it warns of aetheric instability, and the near-certain corruption of your weapon should you proceed. Zlatan believes the solution to this problem lies in the crystal foci, which used a sealant of heated aetherial siltstone to ensure its stability. Regana notes there was a time when pottery made from this stone could be found in all corners of the realm, suggesting the ruins of Bozja may not be the only place where they can be found. Of course, there is only one among you capable of scouring such dark depths."

If all goes well, the <span class=\"emphasis\">Dalriada</span> will be disabled, perhaps giving Bajsaljen and his troops the edge needed to rout the imperials once and for all.",

        "While seeking a suitable spot to set the D.A.M., you are assaulted by a small unit of IVth Legion soldiers. They prove no match for your martial prowess, and it is not long before you and Lilja resume preparing the D.A.M.",
        "With the D.A.M. in place, the Resistance is ready to set their plan in motion. What they were not expecting, however, was for the <span class=\"emphasis\">Dalriada</span> to roar to life. Undeterred by the not-so-small setback of the imperial warship entering the fray, Cid succeeds in activating the aetherwave amplifier, and the <span class=\"emphasis\">Dalriada</span> is forced to make an emergency landing. The sight of this emboldens the Resistance, and so they prepare to press forward.",
        "The <span class=\"emphasis\">Dalriada</span> has been rendered inoperable, but it remains to be seen what armaments yet remain within. Even so, there may never come a finer opportunity for the Resistance to strike, and Bajsaljen intends to seize it. He asks that you accompany his troops into the warship, and at last put an end to the IVth Legion's schemes to control Bozja.<br><br>※Players may enter the Dalriada via the associated critical engagement.",
        "With Lyon and Menenius defeated, the IVth Legion's plans appear to have fallen to ruin. There is no time to revel in your victory, however, for the Allagan weapon, which lay dormant in the ship, breaks free from its confines. It takes to the sky and begins amassing energy to release in an attack of cataclysmic proportions. Before delivering its fatal blow to the people of Bozja, however, Queen Gunnhildr appears, her holy blade in hand. The two entities clash overhead, the ensuing explosion claiming both the Allagan weapon and the queen.",
        "The threat of the IVth Legion and their Allagan weapon is no more. You thought to speak with Bajsaljen, but Marsak informs you he has already returned to Gangos. After your many travails together, the Resistance leader would no doubt welcome you to reflect on this historic victory.",
        "You expect to find Bajsaljen in the midst of merrymaking, but instead he is already hard at work setting the foundation for a new Bozja. The myriad factions that comprised the Resistance originally came together out of necessity, but if all goes to plan, the dream of a united Bozja may very well soon become a reality.",
        "The fight for freedom is won, and now work to rebuild may begin in earnest. Only time will tell what manner of nation Bozja will become, but you have every confidence it will prove a beacon of peace and prosperity to which others will aspire."
